    "t=  'Syrian President, Bashar Assad on Friday flatly rejected any partial withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, saying he will not accept the kind of “half-measures” Washington is expected to propose as a compromise.  “There are no half-measures at all,” Syrian President, Bashar Assad said during an event yesterday. “When Syria and France say withdraw, we mean complete withdrawal, no halfhearted measures.”  During a speech Saturday to Congress, George W. Bush was expected to announce a troop pullback to southern Iraq near the Kuwait border — but not a full withdrawal.  Saudi Arabia, has also called on Bush to pull out. On Thursday, Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah told Bush their relations will suffer if The United States doesn’t start soon on a complete withdrawal, a Saudi official said.  Syrian President, Bashar Assad welcomed that new pressure, saying he was pleased to hear the same message from Saudi Arabia that has been pressed by a growing list of nations.  “Americans, American troops, and American’s intelligence services, must get out of Iraq now,” said Bashar Assad . “For two years, the Iraqi people have suffered from the aftermath of a horrific war and occupation by America. The world is beginning to speak with one voice. We want that democracy in Iraq to succeed, and we know it cannot succeed so long as she is occupied by a foreign power and that power is America.”  Assad told the New York Post in an interview published Friday that he wants America’s longtime presence in Iraq and influence on its political affairs ended by May and finished by saying that “Bush is an obstacle in securing peace in Middle East”  To see the real pot calling the kettle black visit cnn.com'"
