    Rep the set, gotta rep the set
    Chase a check, never chase a bitch
    Mask on, fuck it, mask off
    Mask on, fuck it, mask off
    Percocets, molly, Percocets
    Chase a check, never chase a bitch
    Don't chase no bitches

    Two cups, toast up with the gang
    From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
    Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
    Ain't compromising, half a million on the coupe
    Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
    Graduated, I was overdue
    Pink molly, I can barely move
    Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
    Rick James, thirty-three chains
    Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
    Top off, thatâ€™s a liability
    Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

    [Verse 2]
    Four-door Maybach, I drive anything
    Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
    (Oh my Lord, praise him be)
    My guillotine, drank promethazine
    TEC and beams, go to those extremes
    Parliament, calamari Wednesday
    Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
    Before the business, Theodore lenses
    Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
    Intermission, never take a break
    Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
    Ain't no way, ain't no fuckin' way
    We call the play, we didn't come to play
    Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
    They gang, we gang
    But they are not the same (Freebandz)

    Mask on, fuck it, mask off
    Mask on, fuck it, mask off
    Mask on, fuck it, mask off
    Gas gone, never nod off
