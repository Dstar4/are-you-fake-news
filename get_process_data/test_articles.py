            '''This robot made of algae can swim through your body—thanks to magnets By Elizabeth PennisiNov. 22, 2017 , 2:00 PM  For decades, engineers have been trying to build medical robots that can deliver drugs or do surgery inside the human body—a somewhat less fantastic version of the 1966 sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage. Now, scientists have manipulated spirulina, a microscopic plant and food supplement, to travel through people in response to magnetic signals. The biohybrid robot could one day carry drugs to specific parts of the body, minimizing side effects. What’s more, the robot—and its magnetic coat—appear to kill cancer cells. Spirulina, an alga, looks like a tiny coiled spring at the microscopic level. Researchers had been trying, and succeeding to various degrees, to build bots out of rods, tubes, spheres, and even cages no bigger than a cell. Outfitting these tiny devices with an ample power supply has been quite a challenge, as most potential fuels are toxic to humans. Another problem is steering such a microrobot through the body’s maze of proteins and other molecules, which requires both a way to control its movements and to see where it is. So Li Zhang, a materials scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shatin, turned to magnetism—and living organisms. Magnetic fields created outside the body can penetrate living tissue without harm, allowing researchers to move magnetized objects around inside. For maximum mobility, a helical body propelled by twirling works best. Enter spirulina. “It’s surprising that you can find in nature such a convenient structure and that it can behave so nicely,” says Peer Fischer, a physical chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, who was not involved in the study.       Several years ago, Zhang and his colleagues used the alga as inspiration for a synthetic microbot, which worked to some degree. This time, the scientists decided to use the alga itself. They needed a way to track the robot in the body, and the alga produces a fluorescent glow. The researchers wondered whether they could follow the robot's course near the body surface by detecting this fluorescence, and then use a commonly used medical imaging technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to track it in deeper parts of the body. NMR works by detecting magnetic particles given to a patient before the imaging takes place.  They developed a one-step method to magnetize the alga, coating millions of spirulina with iron oxide nanoparticles. A longer dip time allows for more control, but a shorter dip time allows researchers to detect the fluorescence more readily. When the bot is too deep for that technique to work, NMR can still follow the robot’s course because of the coating, the researchers report today in Science Robotics. Using NMR, they observed the microrobots swarm in a rat’s stomach as directed by the magnetic field.  “It’s a step forward that you can track these swimmers in the body,” says Joseph Wang, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, who is developing a different sort of medical microbot. “And it’s biocompatible and low cost.”  That biocompatibility is an important feature. The microrobot degrades in hours or days, depending on how thick the coating is; yet it doesn’t damage most cells. The one exception was cancer cells, some 90% of which were destroyed after tumor cells growing in a lab dish were exposed to the spirulina for 48 hours. Further tests indicated that spirulina produces a compound that’s toxic just to cancer cells. “The [cancer-killing] behavior seems to be an interesting, unexpected feature,” Fischer says.  But there’s still a long way to go for the half-dozen teams around the world now developing such microrobots. Zhang’s team, for example, still needs to show that its microbot can carry cargo—such as drugs attached to or within the spiral—and deliver those drugs more effectively than just taking a pill or getting an injection. “It’s still not ready for a doctor to use,” Wang says, but he thinks it might be ready in another 10 years. “Everyone wants to realize this fantastic voyage.”''',

            '''  Over the past half-century, college campuses have transformed from a place of honest intellectual debate and inquiry to socialist indoctrination camps. And in many cases, taxpayers like you are footing the bill.  I know, you’ve heard all this before: College students are, generally speaking, a bunch of pampered, over-caffeinated cry-babies. After years of earning participation trophies and being told every white man in history is a racist bigot unworthy of even the slightest bit of respect, what more could we expect?  But as bad as the socialist indoctrination on college campuses has been, it has yet to spark a widespread hatred of the country. College students might want socialized medicine, vote for Bernie Sanders and demand they have their safe spaces, but all these issues have fallen under the umbrella of transforming America — not wanting to see it perish.  All that could be changing. Driven in part by the left’s hatred of Donald Trump, college campuses are becoming increasingly more hostile toward Americanism itself. And “diversity” has become such a grand obsession for some that their hatred of even the vilest of groups now often pales in comparison to the rage many young college students feel when the National Anthem is blasted over loudspeakers at football games or some fool dares to waive the American flag and say taboo things about the United States like, “This country stands for freedom.”  But don’t take my word for it. Documentarian Ami Horowitz recently traveled to the University of California at Berkeley to see how America’s little socialists might react when confronted with two very distinct symbols: the American flag and the flag used by ISIS. Incredibly, the murdering, raping, pillaging, misogyny, and extreme homophobia of ISIS seemed more tolerable to the students than Horowitz’s unapologetic patriotism.  “Greatest country in the world, right?” Horowitz said to one student while he waived an American flag.  “The opposite,” one student replied. “The complete opposite. God, f*** this country.”  The United States is “the one imperial power right now in the world,” another student said.  “It [the American flag] signifies military rule,” an older gentleman replied to Horowitz.  “God is not proud of us,” another student said.  “F*** America!” another student shouted.  If this is how students at one of America’s supposedly elite public colleges react to the American flag, a reasonable person might assume they’d react even more harshly upon seeing Horowitz waive the ISIS flag and shout slogans like, “The black flag of ISIS will stand over the White House,” and “I denounce Western imperialism.” But we’re not living in reasonable times.  Instead of ranting and raving about ISIS’ crimes against humanity, a few students offered positive comments upon hearing Horowitz’s anti-American rhetoric, and just about everyone else said nothing at all.  “I love that you’re saying that,” one student said.  “Good for you, man. Good for you,” another student said.  According to Horowitz, after “several hours” of announcing the superiority of ISIS and waiving the ISIS flag, only one student bothered to respond negatively.  I realize Horowitz’s flag experiment is hardly scientific, but I think it does say something about where U.S. college campuses are today. Can you imagine similar displays being tolerated in the 1940s with a Nazi flag? Or in the 1950s with a flag of the Soviet Union?  College students are learning from their left-wing high school teachers and college professors to hate the United States and everything that it stands for, but for what purpose? My theory — and I realize there is little empirical evidence to support this claim — is that if socialists can associate America and every U.S. symbol with racism, imperialism and other evils, it’s much easier to destroy the values at the heart of Americanism.  For instance, if the United States is the land of capitalism and racism, it’s easier to make the argument both are evil and that the whole system needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the ground up, relying on traditional left-wing beliefs, of course.  Perhaps the worst element to the declining higher-education system in the United States is that most of the colleges are still funded by taxpayers, including the tens of millions of taxpayers who believe in free markets and individual liberty. By paying your taxes, you’re literally helping to pay the salaries of left-wing ideologues that are working tirelessly to destroy everything this country has always stood for.  It’s fair to argue that this means conservatives are, at least in part, to blame for the current anti-Americanism fervor at universities in virtually every state. If all taxpayers are going to help prop the education system up, then the education system should represent the views of everyone, and if it doesn’t, we should stop funding these disasters and force them to compete with private colleges. Further, conservatives shouldn’t agree to send their kids to schools that aim to destroy constitutional rights. If enough parents stood against left-wing indoctrination on campuses, then schools would be forced to change — or close.  All conservatives want to stop the spread of socialism and anti-Americanism, but thus far, not enough have been willing to do what it takes to end the far left’s college takeover. If we don’t act now, what’s happening at Berkeley will happen everywhere, America will be lost and we conservatives will be partly responsible.''',

            '''As our world become ever more strange by the day, numerous UFO experts are warning about what might be the most bizarre event in human history: A “cosmic false flag” where, they claim, desperate governments of the world stage a massive fake alien invasion to finally complete their goal of ensuring total human obedience under a never-ending “the aliens are coming” false hysteria. It may sound crazy to the uninitiated, but listen to the experts below before making up your mind, and check out the Washington Post’s coverage of some of the technology that can help make this happen (link below).  Such an event, the experts say, could be pulled off by a combination of advanced human-made exotic aircraft, advanced holographic technology and a complicit global media already practiced in the art of engineering elaborate fake news (CNN, Washington Post, etc.) to propagandize gullible viewers. Truth be told, most humans believe whatever they’re told to believe, even it’s based on no supportable evidence whatsoever (case in point: the global climate change hoax).  (Note from Adams: Based on what I’ve seen from humanity so far, people don’t even need holograms to fall for a false flag. Most people will literally hallucinate whatever images the mainstream media is trying to put into their heads, literally fabricating false visual memories to fit the narrative they’ve been exposed to in the controlled media.) Dr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure  One of the best known researchers who speaks publicly about a “cosmic false flag” event is Dr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure, an organization dedicated to unveiling the truth about real extraterrestrials as well as organized human hoaxes intended to trick the masses.  According to Dr. Greer, many (but not all) of the so-called “UFO” events being witnessed around the world involve craft that are manufactured by humans. He furthermore asserts that the “military industrial complex” consists of a power structure far beyond the reach of even the U.S. President, and that such interests are planning a “cosmic false flag” event to trick humanity into thinking an alien invasion is taking place. (RELATED: Follow news and discussions about UFO events at UFOs.news.)  See his full lecture here (story continues below):  CLAIM: A global power structure will pursue the radical depopulation of the planet in the very near future via “scripted Armageddon”  According to Dr. Greer, if people across the planet become too awakened and start to challenge the status quo power structure, an “alien invasion” will be staged through the deployment of convincing “alien” aircraft that have actually been developed, tested and perfected by secretive weapons companies like Northrup, Grumman and Boeing. With the help of the fakestream media — CNN, NYT, WashPost and other presstitutes — any narrative can then be pushed as “fact.”  Now that a mass global awakening is accelerating by the day, the staging of this “cosmic false flag” seems imminent, warn researchers.  “If someone tries to stage an event, we’re all going to call it out as the hoax that it is… and not go along with that what I’m calling ‘scripted Armageddon.'” says Greer. He explains that the “cosmic false flag” may be the cover story to engage in a partial extermination of humanity:  They would love to see a shut down of our civilization and the extermination of about five billion people, through a conflict that they will stage, and they will manufacture Armageddon. And that’s the big deep plan that has been in place since the 50s. Those people in the intelligence community who know of this… I can’t even put in words the extent to which they are devastated when they learn this. Because they know how these folks are utilizing religiosity, racism, alienism, division to keep the fire burning. But the big one is going to be the launch of a hoaxed attack on the planet that would look 100% like an extraterrestrial event… and it is not. The technology already exists to pull it off  The technology already exists to carry out a massive fake alien attack that can convince most people of its authenticity. As the Mark Dice video explains below, the Washington Post even ran a story in 1999 detailing how the U.S. military planned to stage an “appearance of God” in Iraq in order to make the people there fall into line.  That WashPo story, which also describes how the U.S. military was able to perfectly fake the voice of any person saying anything they wanted, is still published at this link.  Note that this technology already existed in 1999. It is now 18 years later. Imagine the applications for a massive “cosmic false flag” roll out that fakes the voice of Donald Trump…  The false flag “alien attack” can also be augmented, other experts say, by present-day audio projection technology that can literally project full human speech (and other sounds) into the heads of large groups of people. It’s called a “radio frequency hearing effect.” Search for it on GoodGopher.com at this link to learn more. The following video provides a quick demonstration of this technology at work as part of a city billboard marketing campaign:  UNACKNOWLEDGED documentary in the works  Dr. Stephen Greer is working on a new documentary called UNACKNOWLEDGED. It is described as “a groundbreaking film providing the best available evidence in regard to Free Energy Suppression, Illegal UFO Secrecy, and Government Coverup.”  In the trailer (see below), he explains, “The most dangerous thing going on on the planet today isn’t ISIS, it’s not Iraq, it’s not Russia, it’s not China. It’s an out of control covert group that is not being overseen by the People, Congress, or the President, who have developed these technologies and are recklessly using them to track and target extraterrestrial vehicles.”  Watch it here:  Former Canadian Minister of Defence Paul Hellyer shares his own warning  In a similar warning, former Canadian Minister of Defense Paul Hellyer warns about the “deep state” power of corporations, intelligence agencies, the U.S. military and weapons manufacturers. “Their collective power is incalculable.
