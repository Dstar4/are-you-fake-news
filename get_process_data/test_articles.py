            '''This robot made of algae can swim through your body—thanks to magnets By Elizabeth PennisiNov. 22, 2017 , 2:00 PM  For decades, engineers have been trying to build medical robots that can deliver drugs or do surgery inside the human body—a somewhat less fantastic version of the 1966 sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage. Now, scientists have manipulated spirulina, a microscopic plant and food supplement, to travel through people in response to magnetic signals. The biohybrid robot could one day carry drugs to specific parts of the body, minimizing side effects. What’s more, the robot—and its magnetic coat—appear to kill cancer cells. Spirulina, an alga, looks like a tiny coiled spring at the microscopic level. Researchers had been trying, and succeeding to various degrees, to build bots out of rods, tubes, spheres, and even cages no bigger than a cell. Outfitting these tiny devices with an ample power supply has been quite a challenge, as most potential fuels are toxic to humans. Another problem is steering such a microrobot through the body’s maze of proteins and other molecules, which requires both a way to control its movements and to see where it is. So Li Zhang, a materials scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shatin, turned to magnetism—and living organisms. Magnetic fields created outside the body can penetrate living tissue without harm, allowing researchers to move magnetized objects around inside. For maximum mobility, a helical body propelled by twirling works best. Enter spirulina. “It’s surprising that you can find in nature such a convenient structure and that it can behave so nicely,” says Peer Fischer, a physical chemist at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart, Germany, who was not involved in the study.       Several years ago, Zhang and his colleagues used the alga as inspiration for a synthetic microbot, which worked to some degree. This time, the scientists decided to use the alga itself. They needed a way to track the robot in the body, and the alga produces a fluorescent glow. The researchers wondered whether they could follow the robot's course near the body surface by detecting this fluorescence, and then use a commonly used medical imaging technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to track it in deeper parts of the body. NMR works by detecting magnetic particles given to a patient before the imaging takes place.  They developed a one-step method to magnetize the alga, coating millions of spirulina with iron oxide nanoparticles. A longer dip time allows for more control, but a shorter dip time allows researchers to detect the fluorescence more readily. When the bot is too deep for that technique to work, NMR can still follow the robot’s course because of the coating, the researchers report today in Science Robotics. Using NMR, they observed the microrobots swarm in a rat’s stomach as directed by the magnetic field.  “It’s a step forward that you can track these swimmers in the body,” says Joseph Wang, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, who is developing a different sort of medical microbot. “And it’s biocompatible and low cost.”  That biocompatibility is an important feature. The microrobot degrades in hours or days, depending on how thick the coating is; yet it doesn’t damage most cells. The one exception was cancer cells, some 90% of which were destroyed after tumor cells growing in a lab dish were exposed to the spirulina for 48 hours. Further tests indicated that spirulina produces a compound that’s toxic just to cancer cells. “The [cancer-killing] behavior seems to be an interesting, unexpected feature,” Fischer says.  But there’s still a long way to go for the half-dozen teams around the world now developing such microrobots. Zhang’s team, for example, still needs to show that its microbot can carry cargo—such as drugs attached to or within the spiral—and deliver those drugs more effectively than just taking a pill or getting an injection. “It’s still not ready for a doctor to use,” Wang says, but he thinks it might be ready in another 10 years. “Everyone wants to realize this fantastic voyage.”''',

            '''  Over the past half-century, college campuses have transformed from a place of honest intellectual debate and inquiry to socialist indoctrination camps. And in many cases, taxpayers like you are footing the bill.  I know, you’ve heard all this before: College students are, generally speaking, a bunch of pampered, over-caffeinated cry-babies. After years of earning participation trophies and being told every white man in history is a racist bigot unworthy of even the slightest bit of respect, what more could we expect?  But as bad as the socialist indoctrination on college campuses has been, it has yet to spark a widespread hatred of the country. College students might want socialized medicine, vote for Bernie Sanders and demand they have their safe spaces, but all these issues have fallen under the umbrella of transforming America — not wanting to see it perish.  All that could be changing. Driven in part by the left’s hatred of Donald Trump, college campuses are becoming increasingly more hostile toward Americanism itself. And “diversity” has become such a grand obsession for some that their hatred of even the vilest of groups now often pales in comparison to the rage many young college students feel when the National Anthem is blasted over loudspeakers at football games or some fool dares to waive the American flag and say taboo things about the United States like, “This country stands for freedom.”  But don’t take my word for it. Documentarian Ami Horowitz recently traveled to the University of California at Berkeley to see how America’s little socialists might react when confronted with two very distinct symbols: the American flag and the flag used by ISIS. Incredibly, the murdering, raping, pillaging, misogyny, and extreme homophobia of ISIS seemed more tolerable to the students than Horowitz’s unapologetic patriotism.  “Greatest country in the world, right?” Horowitz said to one student while he waived an American flag.  “The opposite,” one student replied. “The complete opposite. God, f*** this country.”  The United States is “the one imperial power right now in the world,” another student said.  “It [the American flag] signifies military rule,” an older gentleman replied to Horowitz.  “God is not proud of us,” another student said.  “F*** America!” another student shouted.  If this is how students at one of America’s supposedly elite public colleges react to the American flag, a reasonable person might assume they’d react even more harshly upon seeing Horowitz waive the ISIS flag and shout slogans like, “The black flag of ISIS will stand over the White House,” and “I denounce Western imperialism.” But we’re not living in reasonable times.  Instead of ranting and raving about ISIS’ crimes against humanity, a few students offered positive comments upon hearing Horowitz’s anti-American rhetoric, and just about everyone else said nothing at all.  “I love that you’re saying that,” one student said.  “Good for you, man. Good for you,” another student said.  According to Horowitz, after “several hours” of announcing the superiority of ISIS and waiving the ISIS flag, only one student bothered to respond negatively.  I realize Horowitz’s flag experiment is hardly scientific, but I think it does say something about where U.S. college campuses are today. Can you imagine similar displays being tolerated in the 1940s with a Nazi flag? Or in the 1950s with a flag of the Soviet Union?  College students are learning from their left-wing high school teachers and college professors to hate the United States and everything that it stands for, but for what purpose? My theory — and I realize there is little empirical evidence to support this claim — is that if socialists can associate America and every U.S. symbol with racism, imperialism and other evils, it’s much easier to destroy the values at the heart of Americanism.  For instance, if the United States is the land of capitalism and racism, it’s easier to make the argument both are evil and that the whole system needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the ground up, relying on traditional left-wing beliefs, of course.  Perhaps the worst element to the declining higher-education system in the United States is that most of the colleges are still funded by taxpayers, including the tens of millions of taxpayers who believe in free markets and individual liberty. By paying your taxes, you’re literally helping to pay the salaries of left-wing ideologues that are working tirelessly to destroy everything this country has always stood for.  It’s fair to argue that this means conservatives are, at least in part, to blame for the current anti-Americanism fervor at universities in virtually every state. If all taxpayers are going to help prop the education system up, then the education system should represent the views of everyone, and if it doesn’t, we should stop funding these disasters and force them to compete with private colleges. Further, conservatives shouldn’t agree to send their kids to schools that aim to destroy constitutional rights. If enough parents stood against left-wing indoctrination on campuses, then schools would be forced to change — or close.  All conservatives want to stop the spread of socialism and anti-Americanism, but thus far, not enough have been willing to do what it takes to end the far left’s college takeover. If we don’t act now, what’s happening at Berkeley will happen everywhere, America will be lost and we conservatives will be partly responsible.''',

            '''As our world become ever more strange by the day, numerous UFO experts are warning about what might be the most bizarre event in human history: A “cosmic false flag” where, they claim, desperate governments of the world stage a massive fake alien invasion to finally complete their goal of ensuring total human obedience under a never-ending “the aliens are coming” false hysteria. It may sound crazy to the uninitiated, but listen to the experts below before making up your mind, and check out the Washington Post’s coverage of some of the technology that can help make this happen (link below).  Such an event, the experts say, could be pulled off by a combination of advanced human-made exotic aircraft, advanced holographic technology and a complicit global media already practiced in the art of engineering elaborate fake news (CNN, Washington Post, etc.) to propagandize gullible viewers.

(Note from Adams: Based on what I’ve seen from humanity so far, people don’t even need holograms to fall for a false flag. Most people will literally hallucinate whatever images the mainstream media is trying to put into their heads, literally fabricating false visual memories to fit the narrative they’ve been exposed to in the controlled media.) Dr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure  One of the best known researchers who speaks publicly about a “cosmic false flag” event is Dr. Stephen Greer of Sirius Disclosure, an organization dedicated to unveiling the truth about real extraterrestrials as well as organized human hoaxes intended to trick the masses.  According to Dr. Greer, many (but not all) of the so-called “UFO” events being witnessed around the world involve craft that are manufactured by humans. He furthermore asserts that the “military industrial complex” consists of a power structure far beyond the reach of even the U.S. President, and that such interests are planning a “cosmic false flag” event to trick humanity into thinking an alien invasion is taking place.

With the help of the fakestream media — CNN, NYT, WashPost and other presstitutes — any narrative can then be pushed as “fact.”  Now that a mass global awakening is accelerating by the day, the staging of this “cosmic false flag” seems imminent, warn researchers.  “If someone tries to stage an event, we’re all going to call it out as the hoax that it is… and not go along with that what I’m calling ‘scripted Armageddon.'” says Greer.

Those people in the intelligence community who know of this… I can’t even put in words the extent to which they are devastated when they learn this. Because they know how these folks are utilizing religiosity, racism, alienism, division to keep the fire burning.

            '''IS IT correct to find parallels between violent white supremacism and neo-Nazism on one hand, and the nihilist fury of ultra-militant Islam on the other? A Franco-American scholar, Scott Atran, is convinced that these deadly phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Unless people grasp that point, he thinks, our ability to cope with either scourge may be limited. Of course there are superficial resemblances which anyone can see. In August, when a fanatic drove his car into a group of liberal, anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, he was copying a tactic that had already been used by self-styled warriors for Islam in at least four European countries. But Mr Atran, who holds academic posts in Britain, France and America, sees deeper resemblances. He makes the point in an essay for Aeon, a forum for elaborate intellectual arguments, drawing on a series of his own academic investigations.  In his view, both kinds of fanaticism reflect both the failure of the liberal democratic order to inspire anyone to defend it, and the insidious attractiveness of ideologies which challenge that order. What makes these ideologies appealing is not their content but the strong collective identity they offer. They create peer groups that promise their own members such admiration that it can seem like sufficient reason to lay down one’s life. By contrast, surveys suggest that very few people, these days, feel inclined to give up their lives for democracy. His argument is a provocatively pessimistic counterpoint to one aired 25 years ago by Francis Fukuyama, the American thinker who believed then that the collapse of Soviet communism, and of other tyrannies like apartheid in South Africa, portended “the end of history”. In other words: a state of affairs in which there was no serious alternative to free markets and free ballots, underpinned by transparent rules. Citing his own research, along with that of colleagues in France, Spain and Morocco, Mr Atran finds that “there is little willingness to make costly sacrifice for democracy, especially compared with the willingness to fight and die for jihad in Europe.” Statements by Western leaders to the effect that “our values will prevail” have been glib, Mr Atran concludes. As he puts it: Our wide-ranging interviews and psychological experiments have uncovered not a “clash of civilisations”…but civilisation’s unravelling, as young people unmoored from traditions flail about in search of a social identity that gives personal significance and glory. Both jihadism and white-nativist fascism have successively presented themselves as answers to that search, in Mr Atran’s view. And this is hardly the first time in history when disruptive economic growth, technological advances and the fading of old certainties have driven people to terrorism. As Mr Atran recalls, there was a rash of high-level assassinations inspired by the anarchism that started in the late 19th century, from Russia to America. And in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan enjoyed a surge in membership, reaching 4m. Among today’s jihadists and far-right fanatics, there is an apocalyptic belief that a final reckoning with their opponents is not only inevitable, but that it should be accelerated through actions that undermine conventional authority. From that perspective, almost any act of violence can be justified. As an example of such thinking, Mr Atran quotes the grim words of a white-supremacist leader he met: “Evil is the failure to recognise the necessity of race war.” The scholar argues that many Western elites are still in a state of Fukuyama-like optimism which underestimates the threat posed by both kinds of extremism. At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos he “had the impression that most people in attendance thought that the recent surge of jihadism and xenophobic ethno-national populism were just atavistic blips in the ineluctable progress of globalisation.” If his argument is onto something, then at least this much follows. It is often said, with some degree of justice, that mainstream Muslim leaders should be even more energetic in denying any shred of legitimacy to terrorism, and in offering an attractive alternative vision of their faith. But what of the historically Christian world? White supremacists may or may not claim to be fighting for Christian (or even Judeo-Christian) values. But it surely behoves anybody who holds or aspires to moral leadership in the Western world, from clerics to politicians to public intellectuals, to be ultra-careful not to give any sort of cover to nativist fanaticism. And to offer a compelling, alternative account of which Western values are actually worth defending.''',

We had trouble finding any compost that didn't fail federal limits for residential soil for PCB, PAH, dioxins/furans, metal, pesticides etc. and this was "organic compost". It's everywhere.   I hate that the women's section in any store is 70% of the floor and the mens seems to be tucked away in the corner. Girls have a huge variety of fashions and colors while guys are expected to wear relatively drab and conservative fashions that lack imagination or fun.  And yeah, I am straight.  they cut off the gif early, the entire animation is actually way more terrifying. The mini skull drags the crab all the way inside the body.  That's a deep cut.   It's easy to be persuaded by compellingly written articles that appeal to sensibilities, especially those that are unpopular​ to express out loud in a current political climate. I find myself taking a step back and reconsidering which points I agree with if any, and how they join and integrate with the rest of the picture.   Seriously. The bullshit identity politics pendulum swings just as far in the other direction.  Clear risk factors for leakage into fickle and unstable me_irl markets, pepare for rapid peak then quick return to commodity value.   I have this theory that moods are fractals. Cycles within cycles within cycles, from years all the way down to hours. Maybe people have different "fractal dimensions" to their moods.  Well.. you are crazy. Time to own that shit! I feel relieved to have that as context (but not an excuse) for all the times I've acted on weird impulses, made terrible choices, or made others feel uncomfortable. At least now I know why, and that it wasn't entirely my fault. We are all working to be more sane, but why would anyone need to if they weren't crazy? We're taking back crazy.  Mandatory Onion reference: [Music, a mode of creative expression consisting of sound and silence expressed through time, was given a 6.8 out of 10 rating in an review published Monday on Pitchfork Media, a well-known music-criticism website.](http://www.theonion.com/articles/pitchfork-gives-music-68,2278/)  I can't speak for everyone, but ive been on just about every stimulant medication, and vyv has been the smoothest and more tolerable so far  How wude!

The end result is people fight the hardest to change the most inconsequential issues.  From the top of my head,  90  percent or so of suicides are related to depression and most of these to bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Something like 20% of unmedicated bipolar people will kill themselves, possibly more for bipolar ii.   There is an excel for python module where you can write python decorator functions and run them as UDFs. It works, but it's easier to just make a python script that uses pandas or xlrd to write the spreadsheet into python arrays where you can work with them in your ide. Or just save as csv. Excel is never the only option.  It's like trying to find the end of a rainbow. It's a prismatic illusion that will always be in front of you  Use imgur instead,it will work on mobile and the link  won't look like a virus  I use Python (with ArcMap and arcpy) to automate production of a GIS figures - I made a script that looks at a template map document and generates an arbitrary number of copies of the map, each containing its a custom layer file with its own definition query, and so displays a subset of the main data file. Each layer file is a copy of an original layer template which contains an advanced Python label expression to display data in a customized way. The title block of the map is also updated algorithmically. Each map is then printed to PDF. All of these actions are based off a simple list; each item of the list is a 'key' the script uses to generate and print one map. The best part - if a PM or I find something to update, I just update the one template then run the script, a minute later I have a pdf of all 20 maps that contains the update.  Has more upvotes than your shitty comment.   Boom!  Yeah... Your hand..  The SI has the definite advantage of conversions that are intuitive, based on rational design, can be calculated instantly in ones head with minimal memorization and is standardized and used throughout the world. But yes, imperial units can still count things.  I've tried a few different psychedelics since then, including a formal peyote ceremony. I started to feel like there was nothing new those chemicals could teach me, as I already had downloaded all of the information.  L-theanine 200mg works wonders for that. Relatively inexpensive, quite safe, find it on amazon  Lowest effective dose is a good guideline  I take like, 3000 pills dude it's nuts! No, you're right, I meant to say 3mg/day :P  Dramatically worse when you skip a dose, or all the time?  That's an elegant solution.  If the price model depends on the official state of affairs it would be easy to follow and enforce. Emergency rules.   Yeah, without any math just look at it...the curve is symmetrical.   Don't point the gun at anything you don't want to put a hole in.   Note sure if this has been beaten to death, but existential nihilism can be a drag. Life is rich with meaningful and stimulating experiences, careers can be exciting, relationships satisfying. But in those cracks in between, it can feel like there is a directionless drift to your life, with no central purpose or consequence. Not that I think kids are the ticket to meaning, but there is something biological that drives us. If it weren't for birth control I'd have so many by now. We have a drive and the brain gets rewired to support your young.  Apart from a desire for freedom Im not clear on what I want in life or if I feel like a real grown up, but Lord knows most people reproduce irrespective of this concern. I'm just glad I have the itinerary to figure it out.  But then my folks didn't have me until they were 35.   Excited to see what hardcore mode has to offer.   Quit my job (29 years old) and spent a chunk of my 401k money on a custom gaming computer, then spent the next 6 months sliding into a deep depression while obsessively playing Ark Survival Evolved and other time-sucking titles. Ugh.  Still working on the new job part :/  Update of my [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4oezfi/violent_deaths_in_america_in_2014_sources_in/)  in response to some insightful comments  That would be interesting to see, but of arguable significance as the total mass shooting, terrorism, police related deaths are cumulatively 1.3% of deaths shown here.   "Most gun owners are law abiding good citizens!!  I get these vibes before and during migraines. If I ever feel like my consciousness is echoing off of itself into empty space (sorry can't think of better words for it), I drink some water, then find weed and a dark place to hide out. The Lamotrigine stops me from getting super bad headaches, but I still experience the aura, a hypnagogic cocktail of nausea, vertigo, tinnitus, weird daydreamy visualizations, derealization /  depersonalization, flashing lights, clumsiness, confusion, paleness, desire to hide. It's unpleasant and inconvenient but not earth shattering like a full migraine.   At shorter range, nothing beats canister. I've downed so many helis that way, and its always so satisfying.  True and there are likely very good reasons. Could quite possibly break parts of the game if it's still being worked on.  As someone in CS, it sounds like it could be a memory over flow/garbage collection error. It could be that when the value is compared but not written or deleted it's just hanging out there in RAM until the function is finished. Do this with enough cells and bad things happen. Just an educated guess.  Thanks, ironically having a real villain to fight made the game that much more interesting.  Violent Deaths in America in 2014 UPDATED [OC] 	  The Travelling Hippie Problem 	  Violent Deaths in America in 2014 (sources in comments) [OC] 	  Staying home studying CS this Halloween.. 	  A coworker snapped this pod of Orcas in Elliot Bay 	  My coworker saw a pod of Orcas in front of downtown Seattle. (x-post from /r/Seattle) 	  First day without Vyvanse: holy shit 	So I've been taking Vyvanse for 3 weeks now. I thought i'd skip my dose today since I felt tired and it's sunday. This is what has happened so far:   Slept in till 11 (usually wake up at 7), ate mac and cheese for breakfast, listened to black metal loud enough to annoy my neighbors, spent the rest of my day so far dicking around on teh internets *(sorry reddit). i was hungry and didnt want to cook so i ate straight up brie and way too much of it (delicious, but bad idea). and also have not gave the dog a bath which my girlfriend has asked me to do like 10 times. I feel barely able to focus on anything.  i am 27 and acting like i'm 8. the scary part is i realize this has been my baseline for most of my adult life. its amazing the perspective i'm getting from having a reasonable amount of focus and organization for 3 weeks straight. does this sound familiar to anyone else? I am so very thankful for my medication (and insurance)  My favorite rendering so far. It looks so normal on the surface.. 	  Just came up with a way to actively monitor just what the hell I am doing with my life 	I was thinking about what I do with my time and how I have spent much of my time on frivolous but fun and short-lived activities. As with many ADHDers I tend to prioritize instantaneous reward instead of long term rewards or necessity and also have a heinously limited ability to ration out my time wisely.  **Here is my idea:**  Each activity in life can fall into **three tiers** of importance. A small amount of effort spent keeping tracking of which tier I'm hanging out in could make a big difference in improving my quality life. Most people probably do this automatically.  Here is each category, with some personal examples.   ***Tier 1) ESSENTIAL -***  This includes activities and responsibilities that if unheeded will fuck up my whole life.    **Work** - having clean outfits to wear, to paying attention all day at my job to not partying or staying up too late on weekdays  **Health** - diet and excercise 	 **Relationship** - gotta stay on good terms with my girlfriend who has been there for me in more ways than I can count and is generally the highlight of my day 	 **Zen** - my word for keeping a chill mind that is not ramping into the Danger Zone of anxiety and stress. Generally staying relaxed and positive!    ***Tier 2) FULFILLING -*** Any activity that deepens and enriches my experience of life but is not strictly necessary 	 **Reading for knowledge** - science books, serious news articles, certain parts of Reddit  **Education -** preparing for grad school, active learning  **Playing music** - makes life so much better, enriches everything for me  **Friends** - Gotta have 'em  ***Tier 3) TRIVIAL SHIT -*** Make no mistake I **love** the things in category, but they do not and can not sustain me physically or spiritually and generally constitute **short lasting rewards** that do not contribute to future me 	 **Dicking around on the internet** - (Sorry reddit)  **Partying -** Woo!!! My inner 18 year old is not running the show  **Video Games -** Not counting Destiny, that is probably tier 2 for reals.  **Going out -** Spending $30-40 to not be able to hear anyone talk and to slowly damage my health. Maybe this belongs in category 4 - Avoid.    ***Implementation:***   I will use this like a background widget running in my inner operating system, similar to monitoring RAM allocation in windows task manager.   **I will check in as often as I am able to ask myself the following:**   What category am I in now?  IS this where I want to be?  How much of the day am I spending in each camp?  What can I do that would be higher on the list?   	    **TL;DR - I made a 3-tiered system (simple enough to remember easily) to rank activities in order of importance to help me stay in control of my life!**  Terms of Enrampagement, the Enrampaging: How Official309 was Liberated from the Chinese Hacker Mafia 	**First of all, thanks a billion to the Wildcard support staff who took care of this promptly and smoothly.** We could not have freed our server without them.  **Backstory:** A Chinese tribe had been griefing the whole server with Aimbot hacks, hidden turrets, and a take no prisoners approach to diplomacy since the server's inception. Scores of tribes both very large and very small were driven away on a regular basis, as their was no competing with an enemy that could snipe you through metal walls from across the map, and who had turrets that could not be harmed or who's ill-gotten gains provided them with an unparalleled armory of explosives, high quality gear and advanced weaponry.   Anyone who got to the metal tier was soon destroyed. No vault or dinos were safe, large empires rose and soon fell under the iron fist of these Chinese raiders. That was life on our server. After the Snow Biome was released which led to an asymmetric wiping of non hacker bases, there was a mass exodus. All of the biggest tribes left except for a handful. There was no beating MTBT, these players' experience had been ruined by cheating bastards.   **About a week ago**, my tribes main base was mercilessly pillaged, all dangerous dinos unceremoniously executed by these cruel thieving goons. It was't long after one of their members quoted Chairman Mao Tze Dong to me, "Political power comes from the barrel of a gun." Determined to subvert their brutalist ideology, I plotted my revenge. Thanks to Studio Wildcard, it was both short and sweet.  **Fast forward to 24 hours ago**. Someone on global was mentioning they found video footage from fallen tribes of these hackers killing them with hidden turrets and aimbots and was considering reporting it. Intrigued, I searched for this footage on steam and was not disappointed.  Taking /u/Nublsy- 's advice, I sent their tribe name, player names, steam account, base location, along with a description of their typical unsavory activities to reports@studiowildcard.com. In addition I reached out on Steam to those who had been recently wiped, encouraging to submit their own reports. At least 4 or 5 did.  **4 hours later**, while tracking a wild Quetz I ended up in the Hacker tribe's territory. *What had just two hours ago been a staggering metal fortress with more turrets and T Rexes than I felt like sticking around to count, was now reduced to a single stone foundation, owner "Bob".*Timestamp indicated it was last visited by Bob two hours ago. Thrilled but not sure what to believe, I scoped all their other base locations. They had all vanished, save for one, a bombed out shell of a building in the volcano's peak, which was now owned by the all powerful "Bob".  Before celebrations could commence, there was one last thing to be done. The Hacker's main allies, another Chinese tribe - one who had also participated the recent dino red wedding at our base- had to go down. The members of the wiped tribe were already talking to them on global chat, coordinating, regrouping, organizing.  I knew that for this server to be fun again, both tribes needed to have no reason to ever come back. They needed to see only scorched and salted earth in their future.  **And so we grinded mats for C4 into the wee hours**, and when we finally had a good amount, we hit them hard. Only one of their members was around, and he managed to lift me off our Argent, leaving my tribemate and I to fall precipitously. Luckily, we landed in water and returned to chase him off. Then, we returned to their base and **We.  Killed.  Everything.**  All dinos, all doors, all turrets, all electrical, all boxes, all beds, all boats, all bodies, everything was reduced to ash and dust. What was once a large base was now a hollow and useless carapace. Though we did lose some primo dinos and gear in this  battle for liberty, it was an easy sacrifice compared to the threat of their continued presence on our server. Justice was served hot and fast.  Thanks to everyone who helped in the big raid or by submitting their reports to Studio Wildcard, and thanks to the Studio for taking quick, decisive action. **Maybe soon this server will be thriving again**, and a more interesting and fair PvP will reappear where misery and fear once reigned at the hands of shameless cheaters. **It was a good day.**  Lithium, Hydration, Exercise. How I learned to stop worrying and love electrolytes 	Lets talk about Lithium and staying fit.   While taking Lithium has in many ways transformed my life for the better, it has transformed exercise from a fun healthy life boost, into a nauseating march to an early death. Recently I found some workarounds, which have restored my ability to near-normal. I wanted to share because its awesome and I wish doctors told people from the start.  I've always stayed in relatively good shape with the occasional backpacking, climbing, bike ride. In all honesty I'm a couch potato, but have a decent baseline of performance. I can take a perf hit in the name of sanity, but lithium stole 60% of my usual athletic ability, replacing it with nausea, tremors, and weakness, and having to puff on my inhaler every 20 minutes (instead of the usual never). It was twice as hard to do half as much, and not at all enjoyable.   I used to lead 5.11 climbing routes, somewhere between intermediate to advanced difficulty... it was a challenge, but I enjoyed doing it.  A few months on Li later, getting up a very short 5.8 (beginner level climbing) had me shaking uncontrollably, sweating profusely, and wanting to hurl.  What gives, I wondered - is it like this for everyone? Why don't doctors tell anyone this??     Being the complete nerd that I am, I did some research and found some useful info about the dangerous feedback loop that causes this and more importantly, how to fix it. (Feel free to skip to the past the nerd stuff to the solution if thats your jam.)  **nerd stuff**, or what lithium does to your body that makes exercise and staying hydrated a serious and possibly dangerous challenge:   1. Lithium carbonate releases lithium ions (Li+) in your body, which the body stores alongside te other mineral salts (aka electrolytes): Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium).   2. Lithium is a diuretic - it can cause the body make a lot of pee (as I'm sure you've experienced). In the extreme (>2-3 L/day) this is called polyuria.  3. This magnificent fluid loss can lead to electrolyte depletion. The body tries to balance this by excreting more urine, in order to maintain a healthy salts/water ratio with the salt it still has.  4. This can cause dehydration, so the body tries again to maintain salt/water balance, this time by holding on to salts, which increases thirst. As the body treats the various mineral salts similarly, this also concentrates Lithium.  5. The increased concentration of salts causes thirst, so you drink more, pee more, and steps 2-4 repeat in a loop. In the process, you continue piss out the bodies stored up reserves of electrolytes (N, K, Ca, Mg) all while concentrating Lithium.  6. When you exercise and sweat more than usual, even more electrolytes are lost.  7. In my experience the thirst while exercising is unquenchable. As in step 3, the body compensates for low eletrolytes by peeing more. When your body runs out of stored up salts, it has trouble holding on to any water, so you can become dehydrated while pounding liters and liters. Meanwhile the body also has been concentrating lithium the entire time (guessing its reserves are bigger than other salts since you take it every day)  8. This can lead to some combination of electrolyte depletion, excessive lithium concentration, (unquenchable) dehydration. Each of these are dangerous and feel horrible, explaining the hardships of exercising on lithium, and why your friends still having fun and full of energy, while you feel like you are literally going to die.  Here are some symptoms of each:  Lithium toxicity: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, lethargy, weakness, poor coordination (in fact dehydration is the reason many end up in the hospital for Li toxicity)  Electrolyte depletion: same as above + muscle pain, headache, cramping  Dehydration: thirst, headache, lack of appetite, confusion, tiredness     **The solution?** As you've probably guessed: **Electrolytes!!!** I take some especially while exercising, and a little bit daily. I've used Nuun tabs or Powerade powder, started a few days ago and I went from 40% of my physical capacity to more like 85% in one day. lol. I backpacked 15 miles with 2900ft elevation gain in 2 days, whereas two weeks earlier, a 4 mile hike had me in a world of pain. While working out, I feel stronger and more vital-  even my voice sounds fuller and louder.  While this is great, note that too many electrolytes can crowd out the Lithium in your system, and cause many horrible problems of their own. Maybe start by drinking Power Aid while active, or if you are drinking > 2-3 liters of water a day and still not satisfied (my experience even while sedentary).  Very important note: I am absolutely NOT a medical professional in any sense!!!! Just a mad scientist (literally and figuratively) who loves to learn why things happen. Drinking Power Aid isn't  generally something you need to talk to your Dr about, I'd suggest to do it anyway, as it addresses a medical issue and can change Lithium blood levels. In my case, both my therapist and pharmacist recommended taking more electrolytes before I started.    **TL;DR** Don't listen to the water boy- Gatorade is better than water. Lithium can cause a vicious cycle of dehydration, electrolyte depletion, and high Li levels- all of which contribute to a very bad time. Take Powerade, Gatorade, [Nuun] (https://www.amazon.com/New-Nuun-Active-Hydrating-Electrolyte/dp/B019GU4ILQ/ref=dp_ob_image_hpc) (my fav), to avoid this if excessively thirsty and peeing it all out.     [BUG] Body travels on supersonic ocean adventure upon death- Impossible to retrieve. Please fix!!!! 	**This has happened more times than I'd like to think about** and is easily reproducible with the following steps:   **Step 1**: Die in one of several common ways: from some medium to high-impact event, (such as falling off ptera, get pwned by powerful dino), or die on one of the islands slopes (does not have to be steep, ANY grade can do this, including just about anywhere underwater and on ~40% of the islands surface.)  **Step 2**: Watch as your body rubber bands through the universe, and the deathscreen turns blue as you rocket downhill towards the oceanic abyss.   **Step 3**: Watch the "Respawn to bed" distance grow astronomically, until its clear your body is miles away from your place of death and there is little to no hope of recovery.  **Step 4**: Search frantically and in vain for your seafaring corpse, which has apparently gained the superman like ability to fly across the island in seconds.   I *suspect* that this has something to do with how the impulse physics of a deathblow interact with the post-mortem rag doll effects (combined with a lack of friction), but **how on Ark does a body traveling downwards at a terminal velocity of ~70 MPH translate to >600 MPH upon leaving the mortal realm? At least give us a sonic boom!**  Very depressingly, this is an all too common occurrence, and furthermore it is extra tragic to lose your stuff from an uncontrollable and easy to reproduce physx glitch. Dying from PVE and PVP is fine, but this is just lame. Please fix!!!!!  Migraine and Work 	Does anyone else wonder where the line is for missing work due to migraines? I've had at least 2 a week since a head injury earlier this year and I've gotten to the point whee I just try to slog through it. I know I'll look pale and seem derpy and or distant but it seems better than missing tons of work.   Okay is amazing 	A profound thought struck me like lightning a few weeks after I started meds - Actually no - it was more like a warm tropical breeze.  "This is what people feel like."  It's been 6 months since I started lithium, and 4 since Lamictal, I've finally gotten off of SSRIs - and now I feel okay..  Let me explain how okay is the best thing ever - I am in a zone now where I can feel good, fun, happy, light hearted, enthused - but my feet never lift off the ground. It used to be I'd get enthused, then my head would fill with big ideas and I would read, read, read, get super excited, go party, get really fucked up, be the first one awake and feeling fine, talk over people, rant and rave about my new passions, start new projects then half assedly abandon them for the next shiny thing, the whole time ramping up on coffee, cigarettes, weed, booze. I'd get hyped, then I'd get mad about the people who didn't get me, who couldn't see the amazingness of the Truth the way I could. The edgy semi-offensive comments would trickle into my speech patterns, slowly pissing off or pushing away those around me. I'd fight with my partner. I'd consider drastic life changes.  The buzz would fray at the edges. Edgy became 'on edge' became 'on the edge' became the abyss- and down I would fall like icarus for at least a few weeks, usually months. Isolation, burning and directionless hatred, existential ennui, melancholy, then apathy, numbness, bitter hopeless alienation. The whirlwind, the turbulence, the dance of life and death.  But now, none of that is happening, yet I still have the gift to feel intensely. Sometimes I'm grumpy. I can be playful, creative, funny, driven, motivated, insecure, I sometimes stay up until 4am just cuz. I know I'll always be a little eccentric, cyclothymic, artistic, inspired, with moments of genius that sneak up and grab me like a wild tiger. However, the longer term rhythms seem to be fading to the background. The range of long term moods is dialed in, extremes aren't my territory. After a few hours, or a day, any mood just bounces back to normal, like there's an elastic tether holding me to middle ground.  I have patience when people talk, I can handle obstacles without taking it as a grand sign or indication of some tragic flaw. I have stepped off the rollercoaster, and it's super chill.  I'ts like the universe granted me the freedom to be me without the fine print, and it's amazing. I hope it happens to you.  Topamax- is it the devil? 	After a looking through a few posts on this sub it looks like topamax has been a traumatic experience for almost anyone who cares to comment on its use. Today is only my second day but I have to say so far its been amazing. The fog and tiredness I get from it is nothing compared to the apathy I have been feeling from the last five months of constant migraines and I already feel smarter and more excited about life. Just wanted to throw it out there for future readers that it may not always be bad. We'll see how it goes, but right now I am excited for the possibility of less painful days.  "Really? You seem normal to me!" Grr 	This is a really annoying thing and is the main reason I don't want to share my diagnosis with people.  Assuming you can tell what my life is like by the outside view from an untrained eye is one step away from undermining the fact I have an illness and therefore just need to 'get myself together'. It implies the person feels they have the judgment/authority to decide if I'm ill, and therefore decide if I am worthy of their consideration as someone who deserves leeway or sympathy (not that I am looking for those things, I just want understanding). Why not leave the diagnosis to the mental health professionals? They have evaluated me more comprehensively and have the qualifications to understand what going on with me.  What you don't see: I have a strong mind. Its a crazy mind, but willing and able to exert a good deal of energy and willpower in order to be normal. I feel like many people 'just are' normal or close to normal. I can be normal, but only after spending 30-40% of my mental energy budget (at times closer to 100%) pushing back anger, fear, self loathing, self defeating impulses, thoughts of suicide, fiery hate, judgement, sloth, sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, emptiness, spaciness, mental clutter and confusion,  and trying to decide if I making a huge mistake right now without realizing it.   What you don't realize: Its a matter of degree. Great, so we can both seem normal. How much energy does it take you to be that way? 5% of your energy? 25%? Do you ever lose control of the ability to act normal? Do you ever feel staying sane is like juggling greasy bowling balls? It happens to me. All the fucking time. I just hide how I am really thinking whenever I am around acquaintances, and often even family and friends. I've gotten good at this act. "I'm just a chill guy, got it under control, here's a joke and compliment and a funny story see ya later" This invisible double life is my illness. Its only a testament to my persistent efforts that you don't realize it. My superego goes to sleep when I'm alone.  I hate feeling like I need to explain this whole deal to people, and that it isn't just accepted, that people don't really understand what it means, and that I feel a tinge of social shame when exposing my self as BP. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely happy that I was diagnosed as my life history makes sense now and equally happy that people don't realize how insane I feel... i just want to be accepted and understood. How do you deal with this?  Dog or... fruit baskets? For once Deepdream actually reduced the number of dogs in an image. If you squint you can turn the fruit baskets back into a dog. 	  Sapor RDA leaking through 510 pin. 	My Sapor leaks through the center pin whenever I rejuice, constantly kicking my eVIC VT out of TC into power mode. So I remove the RDA, clean the mod out, by shoving a piece of paper towel into the mod, screw in RDA, try TC, and repeat the process until it works. Then, 20 minutes later, it happens again!  I narrowed down the cause to juice leaking down the hole when the 510 and center block pop upwards - despite pin being locked down tight, whenever I screw in the RDA, the center block and the pin go 'click' and pop up slightly, leaving a gap between the center post and the insulator where juice can leak into the insulator, then down the tube, around the tight screw into my mod.   My question is, how can I stop the screw/center post from popping up?  Trying to fuck around with the 510 center post spring in my mod?  (sounds risky)  Jamming something in the RDA so that the post can't move? (if so, what material and how?)  I really don't know. Disappointed in what is an otherwise amazing RDA.  Love the flavorful clouds, but its frustrating at best, damaging to my mod at worst. Kind of a deal breaker if not fixable.   EDIT: Thanks to /u/To0nMan and /u/the_vapors, I had the idea to try screwing the 510 screw through a slice of silicon from the thin part of an [earbud cover] (http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/586/718/360/360718586_270.jpg), then trimmed off the excess around the screw. No Leaks so far!   Does weed help your ADHD? 	I am going to keep this brief: i recently decided to switch from drinking to  trees. The first day, I couldn't just sit nothing in front of a screen.. I had to clean every mess I came across. Then I had meaningful exchanges with my girlfriend and played with the dog.. instead of going on reddit or getting hooked on video games or obsessed with some detailed task for no reason like I usually do. I feel like the weed reduces the obsessiveness and narrow-mindedness from my medication, while retaining creativity.  TL:DR: weed seems to improve my focus and set me towards meaningful goals and self actualization.  Any similar stories?  EDIT: Lots of people saying its 'hit and miss' (sounds appropriate..)  Has anyone heard of high CBD strains? They generally contain low THC, and the CBD works to counteract the 'high' but helps calm anxiety. Might be a good choice for ADHD... I will have to do some 'Research'.. Good thing weed is legal here and [you can literally order it like pizza](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/01/08/i-got-pot-delivered-to-my-doorstep-without-breaking-any-lawsby-an-otter-no-less)!   Vyvanse dies after 6 hours 	Hey ADHDers. I have been taking Vyvanse for a month and half and its been very helpful for my life in general. However, because it wears off after ~6 hours, its not ideal for working long shifts, as I frequently do. I am going to ask my doctor about options, but one thing i've seen on forums is people taking a dexedrine booster near the end of the day. I don't think i should ask directly for that since people are wary of it but i feel like it would be helpful. Anyone have similar experiences with their doctor? Suggestions?  [FO4] [I] [HELP] 3 Round Burst Scripting 	I'm working on a scripts for a three round burst, for new receiver mods.  I am new to papyrus, and not sure which scripts to extend or on what form to trigger the script.  So far I was thinking it would be simplest to extend the Weapon.Fire() function.   **Pseudocode**:      script BurstyMcBurstFace extends Weapon native      Function Fire():        Weapon.Fire()        Utility.wait(0.2)        Weapon.Fire()        Utility.wait(0.2)        Weapon.Fire()        Utility.wait(0.2)      End Function   I got something similar to this to compile and added it to a weapon form, but didn't seem to be activated when firing.   Anyone have advice on this? I know there are good scripters around here.   It would be an awesome mod!!  PSA: Rayon > Cotton 	Just got threw some Rayon cellucotton in my RDA after a few weeks of using cotton. It is amazing. Perfect flavor and no burnt hits. The problem with cotton is that even though I was using temp control, just one mistake turning it up a littttle too high would result in a nasty plume of smokey burnt wick into my lungs, not to mention ruining the wick. The difference between a warm hit and a smokey one was a very fine line, if there even was one.   With the Rayon, it tastes amazing and is much more forgiving with temps- I have yet to get even close to burning it, regardless of how warm I tune it. The material holds its shape in the coil, staying fluffy instead of clumping up like cotton does, and so provides a less crackley and more consistent vape. A $14 roll will last me a year. Between that and $12 of titanium wire, I am set for at least a year. My advice: do your lungs a favor and use a wick that doesn't want to turn into smoke so easily. I wish I had known about this earlier.  Dog or fruit baskets? You decide. 	  Fringe science study seems to confirm consciousness based effects on quantum systems with a purported significance of 4 sigma. What does /r/skeptic think? 	  Any tips for getting through adderall/dextro withdrawal? My soul is melting. 	After studying for 2 years to get a good tech job in a field I love, I got hired, then got laid off after a few months (small startup with management and money problems, I made a few beginner mistakes, but really that place is experiencing kindof a slo-mo trainwreck and I didn't get to the point of being able to prove myself before it all collapsed. Lots of people leaving the place now).   I lost my insurance and can't afford to see my doc for a new prescription or even pay for the drugs if I had one. I don't want to slip down a hole of demotivation and depression, but sooner than later I am going to run out of meds. Withdrawal is very un-fun and makes me feel like my existence is inherently unpleasant. My girlfriend is mad at me for losing my job and doesn't seem to have much sympathy. I'm also bipolar and worried this will destabilize my mood. It's feeding my fears that I am not equipped to be successful. I also can't afford to see my therapist without insurance. I feel isolated.  TL;DR Can't get new meds, running out, rationing them is painful. Soon there won't be any more left. How can I get through this?  Appetite and medication 	Does anyone have ways to increase appetite without weed? Since I have started taking vyvavse about 3 months ago I've lost 5 or 10 pounds.  Actually I look the best I ever have, lean and muscular as I have at least eaten enough protein to keep most of my rock climbing gains.. The issue is I don't think I am eating enough calories to even maintain this new lean weight. I can't smoke weed all day so I need some way to feel the hunger before I start skipping meals. Any ideas!?  I cleaned my entire apartment then made a delicious meal to share with my SO over a hilarious and meaningful conversation 	#pottoblame  Made a module to extract personality insights from a redditor's text data 	  Question - can fertilized eggs be made into kibble? 	It seems like if the 'cooldown' for breeding is faster than the average RNG drop rate, then breeding could be a shortcut to getting more eggs for kibble, or at least getting them more reliably and on demand. Has anyone tried this yet?  Wifi speed all over the map. 	When sitting in the same spot, with a powerful wifi signal, and a fast modem. However my wifi speed (according to System Monitor, speedtest, etc) varies throughout the day from blazing fast (10 - 40 MiB / sec) to tragically slow (30KiB / sec). Additionally, this problem presents on any network I connect to.  It seems to do this without rhyme or reason.  My setup: MacBook 2011, Mint 18.2, wifi cards: Realtek 802.11n NC, Broadcom B4331 (same problem with both)  Things I've tried:  * /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf --> wifi.powersave = 2 * Reboot when wifi gets slow * Turn off bluetooth * Update drivers via driver manager * Try 4.10 series kernels * Update 4.4 kernel * Disable IPv6 in network manager * Use custom DNS (8.8.8.8) in network manager  * Bought external wifi dongle (Realtek 802.11n NC). This is really fast when it works, and works more often than the internal B4331 Broadcom card, but still presents the same issue.  I don't want to buy a new computer just for this issue, but it has been interfering with important tasks every day.   Different results after porting 23andme data to myheritage 	So I imported my 23andme data into myheritage.com. I got similar answers except for one category: It appears a chunk of what 23andme labels as  Southern European, myheritage labels as North African. Either could be true as far as I know. To boot, those regions border one another.   Does any have any further insights into what methods myheritage use to determine ancestry?   23 is quite clear about what data they draw from "The public reference datasets we've drawn from include the Human Genome Diversity Project, HapMap, and the 1000 Genomes project. We perform the same filtering on these public reference datasets as we do on the customer dataset.". Additionally, they describe in detail how they use PCA for dimensionality reduction and clustering. (https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-composition-guide/)  On the other hand, myheritage is considerably more vague about what they share: "...research has shown that these sets of characteristics make each region distinct from the others, allowing us to establish a genetic model for each region of the world. When we get your DNA data we compare it against each of these models to discover how much of your DNA comes from each region." (Source  - information button on DNA ancestry report)  Since myheritage also hosts family trees, it could be that they have a larger pool of labeled data to draw from, although I did not see any mention of this technique.

Earlier in the week I started taking 5-htp, 50mg every 24 hours. The idea was to help with a sense of flattened affect, related to taking vyvanse (which is working well for me otherwise).  Day 1 I felt more emotionally engaged with my life. Day 2 was fine as well. Day 3 is when things got weird. I'm talking about feeling upwellings of extreme sappiness, like coming to the verge of tears just walking down a city street in the cold because of emotional surges for which I can find no conceivable context. I am usually fairly reserved and stoic. Then in the evening I started feeling really jazzed, and hyper and wild but kind of in a desperate lonely way. Makes me feel like I am going crazy with these hyped up/mixed emotions.  So, obviously I am not taking any more 5-htp after that experience- but I was wondering if anyone knows how this may be related to bipolar, or if it is a common effect. BP runs in my family and I have been diagnosed for adhd/depression since a young age (I'm 27 now). I just wonder if this is highlighting an internal tendency towards emotional dysregulation that may be not be explained just by ADHD, since this is not simply an extension of normal feelings, but seems to have a life of its own. I've also felt the same from experimenting with a low dose of SAM-e.  I thought this subreddit would be able to drop some knowledge on a brother. Thanks.  ADHD and rhodiola rosea 	Has anyone else had success with treating their ADHD with rhodiola extract? I feel like i am really at the helm after taking the stuff, and with the added benefit of feeling an increased sense of charisma and sociability. It is almost as good as adderall for maintaining focus and enthusiasm for less than exciting tasks. I recall that the mechanism of action does affect dopamine in the brain but i do not have time to look into that now. Mostly just wondering what other peoples thoughts are. Also- it goes well with yerba mate. I still think I am going to get some adderall for days when i just really need to 'get it together' but days that require just a little extra aptitude i'll probably go for the rhodiola. Thanks.  Let go from new job, next steps!? 	Recently I switched careers from scientific consulting to CS, by taking a year off to study everything I could about machine learning and CS. I learned a lot and was happy to find a job a data scientist for a startup.  Then after 3 months, I was let go, despite my direct manager telling me I was doing a good job a week earlier, and much to my coworkers' surprise. I felt I was not given the opportunity to succeed or fail due to instability in the company (moving targets, and drastically changing directives, etc)  In fact, it feels I was thrown off of a leaning ship to increase freeboard. The company has been experiencing issues with morale, management, funding, with senior staff exiting over conflicts with the CEO/CTO. They set implausibly ambitious goals for the next Q ("we need to bring in 10x the profits as last quarter with the same staff, let's go guys!"). I did my best, and with this backdrop, I assume I was 'let go' and not  'laid off' as to avoid sending out red flags (internally and externally).   I know it looks a lot better to have this experience on my resume than not, but the 3 months time span worries me.   How should I discuss my experience in interviews in a professional manner (besides getting over my feelings)?  Is saying "it just wasn't the right fit", sufficient?  Passing __dict__ between classes. Is it cool or is it wack? 	The other day I cooked up this pattern to suit my needs and I'm curious if it is a frowned-upon or normal. I haven't seen it in my search of Python OOP patterns.  I have a useful class with a general use case, but sometimes there are more specialized operations to be done. To encapsulate namespaces and clarify use cases, I pass the `__dict__` of the first to the second. The second class takes a copy of the first's attributes upon creation. but their methods are not accessible to one another. So far it's proven reliable and useful but I am unsure what to call this and if it is considered 'pythonic', if not what is a good alternative.

During the candidate preparation class for interviewees, we were told we would have the option to code on a Chromebook in a basic text editor with syntax highlighting as an alternative to the whiteboard.   As someone who stopped writing in school around grade 3 and was instead trained to type on a keyboard, and someone who usually codes on a computer (haha), the Chromebook sounds preferable. Perhaps most importantly,  as a left hander, it is exceedingly hard to use a whiteboard without holding my arm at a strange angle to avoid erasing everything with my palm, which serves to makes my handwriting even less legible.  The folks at Google I have spoken to about this (sample size 2) seem to have the opinion that the whiteboard is an old-school rite of passage, and to use the computer might convey that one is not the caliber of software engineer they'd hope for. Additionally, one of them said the whiteboard may serve to facilitate better communication between the candidate and interviewer.  Does anyone have opinions or experience with this choice? I am practicing on a whiteboard, but this only serves to highlight my preference to use the Chromebook/projector combo. It would be easier to manipulate the code, convey my ideas more clearly, and quickly. Better signal to noise ratio in my opinion.''',
        'racism':
            ''' What seems fanciful today can be reality tomorrow.  The election of Donald Trump has pushed white advocacy into the limelight. White nationalism is regularly mentioned, however disparagingly, in the New York Times, and the New Yorker pays attention to it. National pundits such as Tucker Carlson and Ann Coulter openly challenge multiracial dogma.  Driving home from work this summer, I listened to an NPR reporter who had done a “deep dive” into the alt-right, and was shocked to discover that many of its supporters are well-educated and even hip. What many want, he said, is a white ethnostate. He said this matter-of-factly, and the host received the information just as matter-of-factly.  I was reminded of the stages an idea goes through before acceptance: First, it isn’t mentioned in polite company. Then, it’s mentioned, but only to be denounced. Eventually, it was what everyone thought all along.  We are witnessing the total ungluing of the multiculturalist forces in America. They have abandoned all pretense of supporting free speech and even condone violence against white advocates.  Some university professors openly call for the mass murder of whites, or describe the formation of white families as “part of the problem.” Their jobs are safe.  A TV ad for the Democratic candidate for governor in Virginia featured a truck waving a Confederate flag chasing down a black boy, a Hispanic boy and a Muslim girl. The ad was pulled after an actual truck driver—an Islamic terrorist—ran over and killed bicyclists and pedestrians in New York City.  The media continue to be shocked by Donald Trump’s comments and behavior, oblivious to the backdrop of white discontent that got him elected. Millions of white Americans simply smile to themselves.  So, what to do with all this energy? Start talking about the specifics of racial separation.  White advocacy, in its modern form, is a few decades old. It has largely consisted of a seemingly small number of men who meet, write, and speak on a handful of taboo topics. One of the biggest: inherent racial differences and how they make co-existence impossible. This topic is considered unacceptable for public discourse. Liberals seem to fear that acknowledging inherent racial differences is the first step towards genocide.  Proposing an ethnostate avoids this problem. When our opponents know what we really want, they can’t impute base motives to us or conjure up violent outcomes we don’t envision. So long as we make it clear that separation will be gradual, mutual, and voluntary, people are more willing to accept it. If we do not make clear what we want, non-whites and white liberals really do imagine crazed rednecks running children down with trucks.  We are in the middle of an undeclared race war. To end a war you have peace talks. We should focus on specifics: Who’s going to get what? Which counties in our state should be for whites? Which ones for blacks? Which ones will be “multiracial”? Let’s get out maps and start marking them up.  White ethnostates, along with corresponding black ethnostates, Hispanic ethnostates, etc., cut off just about every complaint of unfairness by non-whites. You can’t discriminate against people you don’t live with. If Ta-Nehisi Coates says white racism is incurable, this is the solution.  All races can talk about ethnostates in a positive and forward-looking way, without dragging in tired discussions of the past or uncomfortable conversations about IQ. It’s easier to call yourself a supporter of a white ethnostate than a white separatist, white advocate or identitarian. You support something—you aren’t yourself something, and this depersonalizes the conversation.  If non-whites complain that we “owe” them something or that they couldn’t make it without us, they are conceding that we are better at building and maintaining civilized societies. Of course, as John Derbyshire has noted, blacks almost certainly will be worse off, materially anyway. But what about psychologically? Is the average African villager happier than a black American man in state prison?  The most we need to acknowledge is the simple and observable reality that races don’t get along. This observation assigns no blame. You could call it the “irreconcilable differences” grounds for divorce.  Many will dismiss ethnostates as a pipe dream, but don’t sell human ingenuity short. When you present people with a concrete idea—even a very big concrete idea—they’re good at extrapolating and filling in gaps with their own ideas.  “The Picnic” by Thomas Cole (1846).  Many blacks support reparations; most whites are opposed. But the ethnostate discussion can include that issue. After all the billions—probably trillions—whites have spent on blacks over the decades, they’re probably willing to shell out a few more bucks to be finished with the problem.  Whites, of course, aren’t the only ones to think of an ethnostate. The Nation of Islam has pushed for one for a long time.  We need to popularize the idea. A gruff white worker will say to another, after witnessing typically black behavior, “Maybe it’s time for that white ethnostate.” Blacks could add their voices. Instead of screaming “racism” after an arrest, they could say, “I can’t wait for my ethnostate.”  Some will see introducing the idea of racial separation as incendiary. I disagree. I predict an incredible cooling effect simply by discussing it.  Much of our mental health depends on what we imagine for the future. We can tolerate miserable circumstances if we know they can improve. Thinking about ethnostates will help us all.  I remain convinced that out-of-control multiracialism has taken an incredible toll on America’s collective mental health. The 11th “Stress in America” survey, released by the American Psychological Association, reports that about two-thirds of Americans say they are worried about the future of the country. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed say that the “current social divisiveness” is one cause of their distress.  Government should study the matter. It might result in a legislator calling for “the formation of a committee, made up of residents of all racial and ethnic groups, to begin studying the feasibility and mechanics of separation.” There could even be a lobbying group—ideally multiracial—devoted to the single issue of ethnostates.  America is already pretty well segregated, in both neighborhoods and schools. Liberals constantly complain about this. The idea of an ethnostate would stop whatever desegregation efforts continue.  Instead of “segregated schools” we’d have schools with “cultural integrity.” For the workplace, I envision a complete obliteration of the anti-discrimination laws that have only made whites miserable and non-whites scarcely better off.  The criminal justice system is a major source of racial friction. Ethnostates would solve the problem: White police and the white court system would stop enforcing “white laws” against blacks or Hispanics. Black police and court systems would handle offenses by blacks in ways they saw fit. You could be tried by a jury consisting only of your own race. There would have to be some kind of agreement on handling the increasingly rare case of crimes that cross racial lines.  Ethnostates would not require a racial “trails of tears.” There might be little need for people to move. It could be recognized that wherever you live now, you can stay until you die, but no one would move into an area set aside for people of a different race. “Aliens” living in an area that belonged to a different race might be required to give up the right to vote.  I predict that so long as a given race knew an area was “theirs,” they would not actually care very much about the presence of people of other races. They would be treated well because they would not be a threat. Commerce would continue to cross boundaries freely.  We must push the “right of association” as a basic human right. People of all races have the right to associate with each other and exclude non-members. This right will override anti-discrimination laws.  The Trump phenomenon proves that whites are capable of marshaling their forces, even if they are not yet engaging in explicit white advocacy, and that non-whites screech and become violent even when whites engage in implicit white advocacy. This rage is based on a mistaken idea: that we can all “just get along.”  Modern Israel started as an idea in Theodor Herzl’s head. Today, it’s a nation.  There’s only one way out: esthnostates for all.

        'cuckservative':
            ''' Amerika      about podcast bookstore links   Cuckservative  by Brett Stevens on July 29, 2015  imitation_pasteurized_process_cheese_food  You have seen the meme; now what does it mean? Like so many things in modernity, the recognition begins before the understanding. To use a meme well requires knowing it well, so it makes sense to define this delightfully outrageous term cuckservative.  Ashton Blackwell, who also contributes over at Trigger Warning, wrote up a definition via history that may be better than formal definitions:      After spending about a year in neoconservative Internet circles, always feeling slightly out of place and gradually piecing together that they were playing by the rules as the Left and thus were controlled and toothless opposition, I found a better home in paleoconservatism and traditionalist communities. During my tenure, I witnessed time and time again as conservatives engaged in what is known in their circles as “circular firing squads,” something they purportedly lament, but which none of them pitch too much fuss over because they all have vested interests in not jeopardizing their relationships with gatekeepers to their professional success in Conservative, Inc. The squads are essentially formed to mitigate public relations damage control by throwing an offender to the wolves (other conservatives) when they break the rules of the left (hint: it’s happening now with #cuckservative).   She also mentions a more technical definition:      A cuckservative is a self-styled “conservative” who will cravenly sell out and undermine his home country’s people, culture, and national interest in order to win approval with parties hostile or indifferent to them.   Between these two, the point is clear: cuckservatives are impostors. They value their interaction with the left, a form of commerce, over being true and correct to conservative principles; this has created Conservatism, Inc. which is a Conservative-themed leftist party that has made vast fortunes for all involved. Like American cigarettes are cheap tobacco doctored to taste like the real thing, and like artificial flavoring added to soft drinks to imitate fruit juice, cuckservatives are conservative-flavored System Men who do what succeeds which always consists of flattering the Crowd, and they love leftist-style altruistic policies as a means of distracting from actual problems. For this reason, cuckservatives always get the initial upper hand over everyone else: inoffensive, they offer a variety of the dominant paradigm rather than challenging it, and create a socially acceptable form of conservative that inevitably provides only token resistance to the left.  Anyone who does not play by those rules gets called a “racist” and has their career destroyed by an angry mob. Cuckservatives in fact are kept around as not only controlled opposition, but hit-men for the empire: if a “conservative” feels another conservative has “gone too far,” then people automatically give that critique more credence than if it came from a leftist. Cuckservatism is a socially popular variety of conservatism, stylized as are neoconservatives as liberal goals applied by conservative methods, and like American beer, soft drinks and fast food it is a dumbed-down, denatured and harmless version of the original — actual conservatism — which serves to advance the leftist agenda. It does so by picking up token issues instead of essential ones, and designing obsolescence into all of its actions. Cuckservatives are like good office workers who prioritize getting along with others above any realistic view of a situation, and they exhibit the same disease we see everyone else in modernity, which is that for the convenience of the individual the Crowd demands validation which means that appearance triumphs over reality and those who disagree must be excluded.  Cuckservatives have been the norm since the early 1940s. At that time, people either got on board with the immensely popular government solution to the Great Depression, or saw themselves voted out of office. The important thing to remember about cuckservatives is that they are not the cause of themselves, but they are the effect of the voters wanting a socially acceptable conservatism. To be socially acceptable, you pretend that each person has an equally important viewpoint, and that all can be tolerated simultaneously. Actual conservatives are realists, and realism is the opposite of socially acceptable. It emphasizes results alone and realizes that most people will have hurt feelings because most people are self-deluding, undisciplined, short-sighted and impulsive. In groups these people both amplify those traits, and lose sight of actual goals by the “committee mentality” nature inherent to groups. For this reason, actual conservatives mostly restrain people from self-destruction and civilization-destruction rather than adopt “new” — and they rarely are — ideas in the hope of magical improvement.  The Conservatism, Inc. “stupid party” cuckservatives responded as we knew they would: they called their detractors racists, trolls and psychopaths. The reason the cuckservative meme stuck however has little to do with those who originated it; it resonated with the majority of Americans who are tired of handing the stupid party power only to watch them do nothing conservative with it, and the liberals back in power the next season. The Left (with cuckservative cooperation) is trying to eliminate this group by replacing them with third-world peasants, an idea they hit on after seeing postwar integration work well for the Democrats. All resistance to this process will be stylized as racist, evil, homophobic, trolling, sexist, terrorist and classist, but resistance to it is the only future not just for conservatism and its parent doctrine realism, but for America and the West themselves. If we disconnect from reality, we start a clock ticking toward the day our illusions collide with the hard truth. Generally those crashes eliminate empires and cast their people into third-world poverty. Resistance to this is not a choice; it is a duty.
