One of the first video game programmers was a young woman recently graduated from high years consumer electronics giant RCA released the Studio a programmable video game console along with the Fairchild Channel pioneered the use of ROM cartridges as interchangeable game Weisbecker in courtesy Joyce console never rivaled the impact of or and few people remember it But the true story behind it is Its underlying technology began in as a personal computer developed at home by one man with a Joseph His ended up being the earliest known female developer who wrote video games and got paid for I was alerted to by a fellow tech Marty so little known that back in I declared Carol who worked at Atari beginning in and later designed classic game River to be first female professional video game Though work remains historically it turns out that Joyce work predates it by roughly two she accomplished it without ever being on staff at know there were no other women at RCA doing the she says couple of guys did and they were I think I was the only person outside the company that actually got paid to do a video So I was the first contractor and possibly the first independent video game because I came up with the idea and pitched and they said Weisbecker with her and in years before she programmed her first video courtesy Joyce In Her Weisbecker was born in New Jersey in During her she recalls watching her a relentless develop logic devise stage illusions for local and build electronic inventions in his basement when he working by day at Her Jean was a third grade teacher who emphasized the value of education and encouraged her eldest daughter to pursue what came naturally to she got a Joyce would tag along to her office at RCA to see what was in the engineers looked kindly on the who seemed to naturally absorb everything presented to including a prototype billiards video game developed by playful RCA engineers in the from his engineering job at Joseph was fascinated by the future of a field he became entranced by after reading a seminal book by Edmund Giant Or Machines that Joyce tells a story about in the fall of when her parents first her father told her mother that some day computers would be drastically miniaturized and built into practically and Joseph first became enamored with they existed primarily as vacuum behemoths requiring the electricity of a small city to So the elder Weisbecker experimented heavily with computational tricks that anyone could perform on the he even created a paperback book that played against you depending on which page thus which you technology Joseph began experimenting with computers at A firm called Heathkit sold a wide range of electronic gadgets and appliances that anyone could order unassembled and build wanted to buy a Heathkit to build a says since there any he decided that it was his goal in life to design a Heathkit for computers so that anyone could buy and build the a typical minicomputer might cost anywhere between and put that in the average yearly income for American families during was Working at night for hours in his Joseph designed a complete computer system including a custom central processing out of discrete components and as a personal Joseph Weisbecker designed and built a computer called courtesy Joyce recalls accompanying her father on visits to Radio Shack stores in to purchase parts for his computer He had to visit four different stores to get enough switches and parts to make a front panel for his which had eight one for each instruction Along the he kept quiet about his plans so he arouse suspicion from the store who would inevitably delay him with queries about building a home crazy idea at the experimental computer had a fun name and a courtesy Joyce he neared completion on his first home PC Joseph decided to call his computer or Flexible Recreational Educational He gave it a logo and continued to work on it throughout and all on his own the Cosmac game a family enjoying video games in the comfort of their own courtesy FRED to Studio development of FRED concluded in the father set up his machine in the back enclosed porch just off the dining room of the house in Cherry Soon both Joyce and her younger found themselves playing with encouraged by their And Joyce even began programming was a natural she showed my sister and me how to do My sister was more into taking But I is like really cool just that puzzle either gets you or it It definitely got who had been one of the few in her high school to learn how to use the programmable step FRED machine came to the attention of Joseph managers at but they were skeptical at In the early RCA had just left its golden era with the retirement of its charismatic David His resignation left the company rudderless as his son Robert guided RCA in myriad including purchasing rug companies and chicken On top of RCA had recently been burned by an unsuccessful foray into taking on the mainframe computer resulting in a multimillion dollar ad for the Cosmac a rudimentary computer based on Joseph featuring games by Joyce courtesy RCA turned its attention back to and FRED computer architecture became part of an official project to build a complete computer on a This resulted in the Cosmac a microprocessor system first made commercially available in was then refined into a single the Cosmac released in RCA management steered the project in the direction of embedded computer control for industrial but the elder Weisbecker never gave up his dream of creating an educational computer for the the time Pong was burning up the Joseph tried to sell RCA on the idea of making a programmable home video game but management had little interest in the idea at the FRED technology made its way into a prototype arcade video game cabinet with interchangeable software titles around That project fizzled out But efforts resulted in several home computer including a PC called the Cosmac VIP and the Studio II game dragged their feet for like a year to decide they wanted to be in the home says Joyce then it took them a little more than a year again to actually get the thing And bypassing the FCC the Studio II announced until January couple of months after Channel F had hit the including games on was ready as early as according to guess I get a little bitter about she been the Weisbecker and her show off their FRED computer prototype in the courtesy David Sarnoff At arrival of home electronics products based on her work provided an opportunity for who had recently graduated from high In the summer of while she was on break before her first semester at Rider Joseph asked her if she wanted to program video games for ample experience with her machine she plunged into programming demonstration games for the RCA Cosmac the inexpensive commercial computer kit based on FRED designs that served both as a primitive home PC and a development kit for Cosmac CPU of the code from Slide which VIP owners had to enter one instruction at a courtesy Joyce Race and Jackpot marked RCA programming although she did not get paid for the Her father ran the VIP project on a shoestring RCA included the software she wrote as program listings in the VIP to be keyed in manually by the soon Joyce would earn her first paycheck from As work on the Studio II home game console geared the firm began looking for RCA employee Andy Modla ended up programming most of the Studio cartridge but the elder Weisbecker saw this as a good opportunity for his daughter to get more coding for the subject of his console Joseph turned to his favorite Seeing the Studio II as an inexpensive home computer as much as a game he advised RCA to utilize its connection with the education textbook business of its Random publisher was one of the tangentially related firms acquired during wild and wooly period of business day in Joseph came home and looking for someone to do a quiz on the Studio You want to do Joyce it on your and getting paid for he TV Schoolhouse quiz included a section on a fact that may be explained by the fact it was programmed by a began a project called TV Schoolhouse programmed in early August and delivered to RCA on August for a payment of according to the invoice which Joyce It had taken her about a week to program the simple working at one of her FRED using pen and paper to write assembly code and then entering her work using a hexadecimal one instruction at a Unlike her earlier programming for gained her a credit in the Cosmac VIP did this work Schoolhouse I was a computer quiz that relied on supplemental printed question books that came with the Each player would take turns reading a question in the then typing in a answer on the Studio II The program would check for the correct answer and keep tallied on and Tag fit on one game October of Joyce programmed two action Speedway and In the player pilots a small car on an overhead racetrack verses a second human There was only one The Studio extremely low graphical resolution of by pixels left very little room for who work with modern computers understand the says hard part was not fitting the code in or running on a slow plenty of things you can do with The problem was how do how could you display the state of the game on such a limited You had the equivalent of two Windows and that was your entire Speedway with racing cars represented by limitations explain in Joyce chose to represent the race cars with two white one of which has a black dot in the it look like a car she try doing You You try making an entire game that fits in two Windows Tag is an even more In this each player controls a simple spot on the One player is that player must guide their spot away from the other spot so they Each game is two minutes long and whomever has the most points touch is worth wins the represents nearly the simplest video game one can play with two spots on the a similar game had been the video created by Ralph Baer and Bill Harrison at Sanders Associates in called it chase released the two games on one a choice that came from Weisbecker had room left over on and Tag was too simple to put on its own she I wanted to increase the chance that RCA would buy my race car received for her Tag and Speedway or about in courtesy Joyce did buy as evidenced by an dated November She says these two games took her about hours of sent in the code in October and billed but apparently either they like it or I realized I made it she I sent them a revised and the one they considering the historical significance of these one must remember the Studio that these early titles originated from someone fresh out of high school at a time when very few Americans owned or interacted with Of she had already been programming on one of the first home computers for several years by The world would soon catch By the end of personal computers would be sold in the Cosmac monochrome graphics were blocky even by the standards of courtesy To failed to beat the far more capable Fairchild Channel F to the the Studio II was already obsolete at Atari would release its console the later in from the low one of the Studio key drawbacks was its Touch keypad with no option for a Joyce gives multiple reasons for the including a quest to lower the manufacturing cost to hit a price and the fact that RCA Joseph intended the Studio II to be a stopgap machine until its planned successors These included a Studio III game an intermediate Studio IV home and a Studio V you have a screen with good you put a joystick on says for a later iteration and with a home computer or a deluxe video game if you ever get
