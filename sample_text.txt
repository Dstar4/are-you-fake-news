	 || Just came up with a way to actively monitor just what the hell I am doing with my life
	I was thinking about what I do with my time and how I have spent much of my time on frivolous but fun and short-lived activities. As with many ADHDers I tend to prioritize instantaneous reward instead of long term rewards or necessity and also have a heinously limited ability to ration out my time wisely.

**Here is my idea:**

Each activity in life can fall into **three tiers** of importance. A small amount of effort spent keeping tracking of which tier I'm hanging out in could make a big difference in improving my quality life. Most people probably do this automatically.

Here is each category, with some personal examples.


***Tier 1) ESSENTIAL -***  This includes activities and responsibilities that if unheeded will fuck up my whole life.



**Work** - having clean outfits to wear, to paying attention all day at my job to not partying or staying up too late on weekdays

**Health** - diet and excercise
	
**Relationship** - gotta stay on good terms with my girlfriend who has been there for me in more ways than I can count and is generally the highlight of my day
	
**Zen** - my word for keeping a chill mind that is not ramping into the Danger Zone of anxiety and stress. Generally staying relaxed and positive!



***Tier 2) FULFILLING -*** Any activity that deepens and enriches my experience of life but is not strictly necessary
	
**Reading for knowledge** - science books, serious news articles, certain parts of Reddit

**Education -** preparing for grad school, active learning

**Playing music** - makes life so much better, enriches everything for me

**Friends** - Gotta have 'em

***Tier 3) TRIVIAL SHIT -*** Make no mistake I **love** the things in category, but they do not and can not sustain me physically or spiritually and generally constitute **short lasting rewards** that do not contribute to future me
	
**Dicking around on the internet** - (Sorry reddit)

**Partying -** Woo!!! My inner 18 year old is not running the show

**Video Games -** Not counting Destiny, that is probably tier 2 for reals.

**Going out -** Spending $30-40 to not be able to hear anyone talk and to slowly damage my health. Maybe this belongs in category 4 - Avoid.



***Implementation:*** 

I will use this like a background widget running in my inner operating system, similar to monitoring RAM allocation in windows task manager. 

**I will check in as often as I am able to ask myself the following:** 

What category am I in now?

IS this where I want to be?

How much of the day am I spending in each camp?

What can I do that would be higher on the list?


	



**TL;DR - I made a 3-tiered system (simple enough to remember easily) to rank activities in order of importance to help me stay in control of my life!** || Terms of Enrampagement, the Enrampaging: How Official309 was Liberated from the Chinese Hacker Mafia
	**First of all, thanks a billion to the Wildcard support staff who took care of this promptly and smoothly.** We could not have freed our server without them.

**Backstory:** A Chinese tribe had been griefing the whole server with Aimbot hacks, hidden turrets, and a take no prisoners approach to diplomacy since the server's inception. Scores of tribes both very large and very small were driven away on a regular basis, as their was no competing with an enemy that could snipe you through metal walls from across the map, and who had turrets that could not be harmed or who's ill-gotten gains provided them with an unparalleled armory of explosives, high quality gear and advanced weaponry. 

Anyone who got to the metal tier was soon destroyed. No vault or dinos were safe, large empires rose and soon fell under the iron fist of these Chinese raiders. That was life on our server. After the Snow Biome was released which led to an asymmetric wiping of non hacker bases, there was a mass exodus. All of the biggest tribes left except for a handful. There was no beating MTBT, these players' experience had been ruined by cheating bastards. 

**About a week ago**, my tribes main base was mercilessly pillaged, all dangerous dinos unceremoniously executed by these cruel thieving goons. It was't long after one of their members quoted Chairman Mao Tze Dong to me, "Political power comes from the barrel of a gun." Determined to subvert their brutalist ideology, I plotted my revenge. Thanks to Studio Wildcard, it was both short and sweet.

**Fast forward to 24 hours ago**. Someone on global was mentioning they found video footage from fallen tribes of these hackers killing them with hidden turrets and aimbots and was considering reporting it. Intrigued, I searched for this footage on steam and was not disappointed.

Taking /u/Nublsy- 's advice, I sent their tribe name, player names, steam account, base location, along with a description of their typical unsavory activities to reports@studiowildcard.com. In addition I reached out on Steam to those who had been recently wiped, encouraging to submit their own reports. At least 4 or 5 did.

**4 hours later**, while tracking a wild Quetz I ended up in the Hacker tribe's territory. *What had just two hours ago been a staggering metal fortress with more turrets and T Rexes than I felt like sticking around to count, was now reduced to a single stone foundation, owner "Bob".*Timestamp indicated it was last visited by Bob two hours ago. Thrilled but not sure what to believe, I scoped all their other base locations. They had all vanished, save for one, a bombed out shell of a building in the volcano's peak, which was now owned by the all powerful "Bob".

Before celebrations could commence, there was one last thing to be done. The Hacker's main allies, another Chinese tribe - one who had also participated the recent dino red wedding at our base- had to go down. The members of the wiped tribe were already talking to them on global chat, coordinating, regrouping, organizing.

I knew that for this server to be fun again, both tribes needed to have no reason to ever come back. They needed to see only scorched and salted earth in their future. 
**And so we grinded mats for C4 into the wee hours**, and when we finally had a good amount, we hit them hard. Only one of their members was around, and he managed to lift me off our Argent, leaving my tribemate and I to fall precipitously. Luckily, we landed in water and returned to chase him off. Then, we returned to their base and
**We. 
Killed. 
Everything.**

All dinos, all doors, all turrets, all electrical, all boxes, all beds, all boats, all bodies, everything was reduced to ash and dust. What was once a large base was now a hollow and useless carapace. Though we did lose some primo dinos and gear in this  battle for liberty, it was an easy sacrifice compared to the threat of their continued presence on our server. Justice was served hot and fast.

Thanks to everyone who helped in the big raid or by submitting their reports to Studio Wildcard, and thanks to the Studio for taking quick, decisive action. **Maybe soon this server will be thriving again**, and a more interesting and fair PvP will reappear where misery and fear once reigned at the hands of shameless cheaters. **It was a good day.** || Lithium, Hydration, Exercise. How I learned to stop worrying and love electrolytes
	Lets talk about Lithium and staying fit. 

While taking Lithium has in many ways transformed my life for the better, it has transformed exercise from a fun healthy life boost, into a nauseating march to an early death. Recently I found some workarounds, which have restored my ability to near-normal. I wanted to share because its awesome and I wish doctors told people from the start.

I've always stayed in relatively good shape with the occasional backpacking, climbing, bike ride. In all honesty I'm a couch potato, but have a decent baseline of performance. I can take a perf hit in the name of sanity, but lithium stole 60% of my usual athletic ability, replacing it with nausea, tremors, and weakness, and having to puff on my inhaler every 20 minutes (instead of the usual never). It was twice as hard to do half as much, and not at all enjoyable. 

I used to lead 5.11 climbing routes, somewhere between intermediate to advanced difficulty... it was a challenge, but I enjoyed doing it. 
A few months on Li later, getting up a very short 5.8 (beginner level climbing) had me shaking uncontrollably, sweating profusely, and wanting to hurl.  What gives, I wondered - is it like this for everyone? Why don't doctors tell anyone this??




Being the complete nerd that I am, I did some research and found some useful info about the dangerous feedback loop that causes this and more importantly, how to fix it. (Feel free to skip to the past the nerd stuff to the solution if thats your jam.)

**nerd stuff**, or what lithium does to your body that makes exercise and staying hydrated a serious and possibly dangerous challenge:


1. Lithium carbonate releases lithium ions (Li+) in your body, which the body stores alongside te other mineral salts (aka electrolytes): Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium). 

2. Lithium is a diuretic - it can cause the body make a lot of pee (as I'm sure you've experienced). In the extreme (>2-3 L/day) this is called polyuria.

3. This magnificent fluid loss can lead to electrolyte depletion. The body tries to balance this by excreting more urine, in order to maintain a healthy salts/water ratio with the salt it still has.

4. This can cause dehydration, so the body tries again to maintain salt/water balance, this time by holding on to salts, which increases thirst. As the body treats the various mineral salts similarly, this also concentrates Lithium.

5. The increased concentration of salts causes thirst, so you drink more, pee more, and steps 2-4 repeat in a loop. In the process, you continue piss out the bodies stored up reserves of electrolytes (N, K, Ca, Mg) all while concentrating Lithium.

6. When you exercise and sweat more than usual, even more electrolytes are lost.

7. In my experience the thirst while exercising is unquenchable. As in step 3, the body compensates for low eletrolytes by peeing more. When your body runs out of stored up salts, it has trouble holding on to any water, so you can become dehydrated while pounding liters and liters. Meanwhile the body also has been concentrating lithium the entire time (guessing its reserves are bigger than other salts since you take it every day)

8. This can lead to some combination of electrolyte depletion, excessive lithium concentration, (unquenchable) dehydration. Each of these are dangerous and feel horrible, explaining the hardships of exercising on lithium, and why your friends still having fun and full of energy, while you feel like you are literally going to die.

Here are some symptoms of each:

Lithium toxicity: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, lethargy, weakness, poor coordination (in fact dehydration is the reason many end up in the hospital for Li toxicity)

Electrolyte depletion: same as above + muscle pain, headache, cramping

Dehydration: thirst, headache, lack of appetite, confusion, tiredness




**The solution?** As you've probably guessed: **Electrolytes!!!** I take some especially while exercising, and a little bit daily. I've used Nuun tabs or Powerade powder, started a few days ago and I went from 40% of my physical capacity to more like 85% in one day. lol. I backpacked 15 miles with 2900ft elevation gain in 2 days, whereas two weeks earlier, a 4 mile hike had me in a world of pain. While working out, I feel stronger and more vital-  even my voice sounds fuller and louder.

While this is great, note that too many electrolytes can crowd out the Lithium in your system, and cause many horrible problems of their own. Maybe start by drinking Power Aid while active, or if you are drinking > 2-3 liters of water a day and still not satisfied (my experience even while sedentary).

Very important note: I am absolutely NOT a medical professional in any sense!!!! Just a mad scientist (literally and figuratively) who loves to learn why things happen. Drinking Power Aid isn't  generally something you need to talk to your Dr about, I'd suggest to do it anyway, as it addresses a medical issue and can change Lithium blood levels. In my case, both my therapist and pharmacist recommended taking more electrolytes before I started.



**TL;DR** Don't listen to the water boy- Gatorade is better than water. Lithium can cause a vicious cycle of dehydration, electrolyte depletion, and high Li levels- all of which contribute to a very bad time. Take Powerade, Gatorade, [Nuun] (https://www.amazon.com/New-Nuun-Active-Hydrating-Electrolyte/dp/B019GU4ILQ/ref=dp_ob_image_hpc) (my fav), to avoid this if excessively thirsty and peeing it all out.


 || [BUG] Body travels on supersonic ocean adventure upon death- Impossible to retrieve. Please fix!!!!
	**This has happened more times than I'd like to think about** and is easily reproducible with the following steps:


**Step 1**: Die in one of several common ways: from some medium to high-impact event, (such as falling off ptera, get pwned by powerful dino), or die on one of the islands slopes (does not have to be steep, ANY grade can do this, including just about anywhere underwater and on ~40% of the islands surface.)

**Step 2**: Watch as your body rubber bands through the universe, and the deathscreen turns blue as you rocket downhill towards the oceanic abyss. 

**Step 3**: Watch the "Respawn to bed" distance grow astronomically, until its clear your body is miles away from your place of death and there is little to no hope of recovery.

**Step 4**: Search frantically and in vain for your seafaring corpse, which has apparently gained the superman like ability to fly across the island in seconds.
 
I *suspect* that this has something to do with how the impulse physics of a deathblow interact with the post-mortem rag doll effects (combined with a lack of friction), but **how on Ark does a body traveling downwards at a terminal velocity of ~70 MPH translate to >600 MPH upon leaving the mortal realm? At least give us a sonic boom!**

Very depressingly, this is an all too common occurrence, and furthermore it is extra tragic to lose your stuff from an uncontrollable and easy to reproduce physx glitch. Dying from PVE and PVP is fine, but this is just lame. Please fix!!!!! || Migraine and Work

	A profound thought struck me like lightning a few weeks after I started meds - Actually no - it was more like a warm tropical breeze.  "This is what people feel like."

It's been 6 months since I started lithium, and 4 since Lamictal, I've finally gotten off of SSRIs - and now I feel okay..

Let me explain how okay is the best thing ever - I am in a zone now where I can feel good, fun, happy, light hearted, enthused - but my feet never lift off the ground. It used to be I'd get enthused, then my head would fill with big ideas and I would read, read, read, get super excited, go party, get really fucked up, be the first one awake and feeling fine, talk over people, rant and rave about my new passions, start new projects then half assedly abandon them for the next shiny thing, the whole time ramping up on coffee, cigarettes, weed, booze. I'd get hyped, then I'd get mad about the people who didn't get me, who couldn't see the amazingness of the Truth the way I could. The edgy semi-offensive comments would trickle into my speech patterns, slowly pissing off or pushing away those around me. I'd fight with my partner. I'd consider drastic life changes.

The buzz would fray at the edges. Edgy became 'on edge' became 'on the edge' became the abyss- and down I would fall like icarus for at least a few weeks, usually months. Isolation, burning and directionless hatred, existential ennui, melancholy, then apathy, numbness, bitter hopeless alienation. The whirlwind, the turbulence, the dance of life and death.

But now, none of that is happening, yet I still have the gift to feel intensely. Sometimes I'm grumpy. I can be playful, creative, funny, driven, motivated, insecure, I sometimes stay up until 4am just cuz. I know I'll always be a little eccentric, cyclothymic, artistic, inspired, with moments of genius that sneak up and grab me like a wild tiger. However, the longer term rhythms seem to be fading to the background. The range of long term moods is dialed in, extremes aren't my territory. After a few hours, or a day, any mood just bounces back to normal, like there's an elastic tether holding me to middle ground.  I have patience when people talk, I can handle obstacles without taking it as a grand sign or indication of some tragic flaw. I have stepped off the rollercoaster, and it's super chill.

I'ts like the universe granted me the freedom to be me without the fine print, and it's amazing. I hope it happens to you. || Topamax- is it the devil?
	After a looking through a few posts on this sub it looks like topamax has been a traumatic experience for almost anyone who cares to comment on its use. Today is only my second day but I have to say so far its been amazing. The fog and tiredness I get from it is nothing compared to the apathy I have been feeling from the last five months of constant migraines and I already feel smarter and more excited about life. Just wanted to throw it out there for future readers that it may not always be bad. We'll see how it goes, but right now I am excited for the possibility of less painful days. || "Really? You seem normal to me!" Grr
	This is a really annoying thing and is the main reason I don't want to share my diagnosis with people.  Assuming you can tell what my life is like by the outside view from an untrained eye is one step away from undermining the fact I have an illness and therefore just need to 'get myself together'. It implies the person feels they have the judgment/authority to decide if I'm ill, and therefore decide if I am worthy of their consideration as someone who deserves leeway or sympathy (not that I am looking for those things, I just want understanding). Why not leave the diagnosis to the mental health professionals? They have evaluated me more comprehensively and have the qualifications to understand what going on with me.

What you don't see: I have a strong mind. Its a crazy mind, but willing and able to exert a good deal of energy and willpower in order to be normal. I feel like many people 'just are' normal or close to normal. I can be normal, but only after spending 30-40% of my mental energy budget (at times closer to 100%) pushing back anger, fear, self loathing, self defeating impulses, thoughts of suicide, fiery hate, judgement, sloth, sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, emptiness, spaciness, mental clutter and confusion,  and trying to decide if I making a huge mistake right now without realizing it. 

What you don't realize: Its a matter of degree. Great, so we can both seem normal. How much energy does it take you to be that way? 5% of your energy? 25%? Do you ever lose control of the ability to act normal? Do you ever feel staying sane is like juggling greasy bowling balls? It happens to me. All the fucking time. I just hide how I am really thinking whenever I am around acquaintances, and often even family and friends. I've gotten good at this act. "I'm just a chill guy, got it under control, here's a joke and compliment and a funny story see ya later" This invisible double life is my illness. Its only a testament to my persistent efforts that you don't realize it. My superego goes to sleep when I'm alone.

I hate feeling like I need to explain this whole deal to people, and that it isn't just accepted, that people don't really understand what it means, and that I feel a tinge of social shame when exposing my self as BP. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely happy that I was diagnosed as my life history makes sense now and equally happy that people don't realize how insane I feel... i just want to be accepted and understood. How do you deal with this? || Dog or... fruit baskets? For once Deepdream actually reduced the number of dogs in an image. If you squint you can turn the fruit baskets back into a dog.
	 || Sapor RDA leaking through 510 pin.
	My Sapor leaks through the center pin whenever I rejuice, constantly kicking my eVIC VT out of TC into power mode. So I remove the RDA, clean the mod out, by shoving a piece of paper towel into the mod, screw in RDA, try TC, and repeat the process until it works. Then, 20 minutes later, it happens again!

I narrowed down the cause to juice leaking down the hole when the 510 and center block pop upwards - despite pin being locked down tight, whenever I screw in the RDA, the center block and the pin go 'click' and pop up slightly, leaving a gap between the center post and the insulator where juice can leak into the insulator, then down the tube, around the tight screw into my mod. 

My question is, how can I stop the screw/center post from popping up?

Trying to fuck around with the 510 center post spring in my mod?  (sounds risky)

Jamming something in the RDA so that the post can't move? (if so, what material and how?)

I really don't know. Disappointed in what is an otherwise amazing RDA.  Love the flavorful clouds, but its frustrating at best, damaging to my mod at worst. Kind of a deal breaker if not fixable.


EDIT: Thanks to /u/To0nMan and /u/the_vapors, I had the idea to try screwing the 510 screw through a slice of silicon from the thin part of an [earbud cover] (http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/586/718/360/360718586_270.jpg), then trimmed off the excess around the screw. No Leaks so far!  || Does weed help your ADHD?
	I am going to keep this brief: i recently decided to switch from drinking to  trees. The first day, I couldn't just sit nothing in front of a screen.. I had to clean every mess I came across. Then I had meaningful exchanges with my girlfriend and played with the dog.. instead of going on reddit or getting hooked on video games or obsessed with some detailed task for no reason like I usually do. I feel like the weed reduces the obsessiveness and narrow-mindedness from my medication, while retaining creativity.

TL:DR: weed seems to improve my focus and set me towards meaningful goals and self actualization.

Any similar stories?

EDIT: Lots of people saying its 'hit and miss' (sounds appropriate..)
 Has anyone heard of high CBD strains? They generally contain low THC, and the CBD works to counteract the 'high' but helps calm anxiety. Might be a good choice for ADHD...

 || Vyvanse dies after 6 hours
	Hey ADHDers. I have been taking Vyvanse for a month and half and its been very helpful for my life in general. However, because it wears off after ~6 hours, its not ideal for working long shifts, as I frequently do.
I am going to ask my doctor about options, but one thing i've seen on forums is people taking a dexedrine booster near the end of the day. I don't think i should ask directly for that since people are wary of it but i feel like it would be helpful. Anyone have similar experiences with their doctor? Suggestions? || [FO4] [I] [HELP] 3 Round Burst Scripting
	I'm working on a scripts for a three round burst, for new receiver mods. 
I am new to papyrus, and not sure which scripts to extend or on what form to trigger the script.

So far I was thinking it would be simplest to extend the Weapon.Fire() function. 

**Pseudocode**:

    script BurstyMcBurstFace extends Weapon native

    Function Fire():

      Weapon.Fire()

      Utility.wait(0.2)

      Weapon.Fire()

      Utility.wait(0.2)

      Weapon.Fire()

      Utility.wait(0.2)

    End Function


I got something similar to this to compile and added it to a weapon form, but didn't seem to be activated when firing.


Anyone have advice on this? I know there are good scripters around here. 

It would be an awesome mod!! || PSA: Rayon > Cotton
	Just got threw some Rayon cellucotton in my RDA after a few weeks of using cotton. It is amazing. Perfect flavor and no burnt hits. The problem with cotton is that even though I was using temp control, just one mistake turning it up a littttle too high would result in a nasty plume of smokey burnt wick into my lungs, not to mention ruining the wick. The difference between a warm hit and a smokey one was a very fine line, if there even was one. 

With the Rayon, it tastes amazing and is much more forgiving with temps- I have yet to get even close to burning it, regardless of how warm I tune it. The material holds its shape in the coil, staying fluffy instead of clumping up like cotton does, and so provides a less crackley and more consistent vape. A $14 roll will last me a year. Between that and $12 of titanium wire, I am set for at least a year. My advice: do your lungs a favor and use a wick that doesn't want to turn into smoke so easily. I wish I had known about this earlier. || Dog or fruit baskets? You decide.

	 || Any tips for getting through adderall/dextro withdrawal? My soul is melting.
	After studying for 2 years to get a good tech job in a field I love, I got hired, then got laid off after a few months (small startup with management and money problems, I made a few beginner mistakes, but really that place is experiencing kindof a slo-mo trainwreck and I didn't get to the point of being able to prove myself before it all collapsed. Lots of people leaving the place now). 

I lost my insurance and can't afford to see my doc for a new prescription or even pay for the drugs if I had one. I don't want to slip down a hole of demotivation and depression, but sooner than later I am going to run out of meds. Withdrawal is very un-fun and makes me feel like my existence is inherently unpleasant. My girlfriend is mad at me for losing my job and doesn't seem to have much sympathy. I'm also bipolar and worried this will destabilize my mood. It's feeding my fears that I am not equipped to be successful. I also can't afford to see my therapist without insurance. I feel isolated.

TL;DR Can't get new meds, running out, rationing them is painful. Soon there won't be any more left. How can I get through this? || Appetite and medication

Actually I look the best I ever have, lean and muscular as I have at least eaten enough protein to keep most of my rock climbing gains.. The issue is I don't think I am eating enough calories to even maintain this new lean weight. I can't smoke weed all day so I need some way to feel the hunger before I start skipping meals.

	When sitting in the same spot, with a powerful wifi signal, and a fast modem. However my wifi speed (according to System Monitor, speedtest, etc) varies throughout the day from blazing fast (10 - 40 MiB / sec) to tragically slow (30KiB / sec). Additionally, this problem presents on any network I connect to.

It seems to do this without rhyme or reason.

My setup: MacBook 2011, Mint 18.2, wifi cards: Realtek 802.11n NC, Broadcom B4331 (same problem with both)

Things I've tried:

* /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf --> wifi.powersave = 2
* Reboot when wifi gets slow
* Turn off bluetooth
* Update drivers via driver manager
* Try 4.10 series kernels
* Update 4.4 kernel
* Disable IPv6 in network manager
* Use custom DNS (8.8.8.8) in network manager 
* Bought external wifi dongle (Realtek 802.11n NC). This is really fast when it works, and works more often than the internal B4331 Broadcom card, but still presents the same issue.

I don't want to buy a new computer just for this issue, but it has been interfering with important tasks every day.
 || Different results after porting 23andme data to myheritage
	So I imported my 23andme data into myheritage.com. I got similar answers except for one category: It appears a chunk of what 23andme labels as  Southern European, myheritage labels as North African. Either could be true as far as I know. To boot, those regions border one another. 

Does any have any further insights into what methods myheritage use to determine ancestry? 

23 is quite clear about what data they draw from "The public reference datasets we've drawn from include the Human Genome Diversity Project, HapMap, and the 1000 Genomes project. We perform the same filtering on these public reference datasets as we do on the customer dataset.". Additionally, they describe in detail how they use PCA for dimensionality reduction and clustering. (https://www.23andme.com/ancestry-composition-guide/)

On the other hand, myheritage is considerably more vague about what they share: "...research has shown that these sets of characteristics make each region distinct from the others, allowing us to establish a genetic model for each region of the world. When we get your DNA data we compare it against each of these models to discover how much of your DNA comes from each region." (Source  - information button on DNA ancestry report)

Since myheritage also hosts family trees, it could be that they have a larger pool of labeled data to draw from, although I did not see any mention of this technique. 

Location | myheritage | 23andme | Difference
---|----|---|---
North and West Europe|45.5% |39.9%|5.6%
South Europe | 38.6%|57.2%|-19%

	 || 5-HTP and Mania/Extreme emotions - Indication of bipolar?
	Earlier in the week I started taking 5-htp, 50mg every 24 hours. The idea was to help with a sense of flattened affect, related to taking vyvanse (which is working well for me otherwise).

Day 1 I felt more emotionally engaged with my life. Day 2 was fine as well. Day 3 is when things got weird. I'm talking about feeling upwellings of extreme sappiness, like coming to the verge of tears just walking down a city street in the cold because of emotional surges for which I can find no conceivable context. I am usually fairly reserved and stoic. Then in the evening I started feeling really jazzed, and hyper and wild but kind of in a desperate lonely way. Makes me feel like I am going crazy with these hyped up/mixed emotions.

So, obviously I am not taking any more 5-htp after that experience- but I was wondering if anyone knows how this may be related to bipolar, or if it is a common effect. BP runs in my family and I have been diagnosed for adhd/depression since a young age (I'm 27 now). I just wonder if this is highlighting an internal tendency towards emotional dysregulation that may be not be explained just by ADHD, since this is not simply an extension of normal feelings, but seems to have a life of its own. I've also felt the same from experimenting with a low dose of SAM-e.

I thought this subreddit would be able to drop some knowledge on a brother. Thanks. || ADHD and rhodiola rosea
	Has anyone else had success with treating their ADHD with rhodiola extract? I feel like i am really at the helm after taking the stuff, and with the added benefit of feeling an increased sense of charisma and sociability. It is almost as good as adderall for maintaining focus and enthusiasm for less than exciting tasks. I recall that the mechanism of action does affect dopamine in the brain but i do not have time to look into that now. Mostly just wondering what other peoples thoughts are. Also- it goes well with yerba mate. I still think I am going to get some adderall for days when i just really need to 'get it together' but days that require just a little extra aptitude i'll probably go for the rhodiola.
Thanks. || Let go from new job, next steps!?
	Recently I switched careers from scientific consulting to CS, by taking a year off to study everything I could about machine learning and CS. I learned a lot and was happy to find a job a data scientist for a startup.

Then after 3 months, I was let go, despite my direct manager telling me I was doing a good job a week earlier, and much to my coworkers' surprise. I felt I was not given the opportunity to succeed or fail due to instability in the company (moving targets, and drastically changing directives, etc)

In fact, it feels I was thrown off of a leaning ship to increase freeboard. The company has been experiencing issues with morale, management, funding, with senior staff exiting over conflicts with the CEO/CTO. They set implausibly ambitious goals for the next Q ("we need to bring in 10x the profits as last quarter with the same staff, let's go guys!"). I did my best, and with this backdrop, I assume I was 'let go' and not  'laid off' as to avoid sending out red flags (internally and externally). 

I know it looks a lot better to have this experience on my resume than not, but the 3 months time span worries me. 

How should I discuss my experience in interviews in a professional manner (besides getting over my feelings)? 
Is saying "it just wasn't the right fit", sufficient? || Passing __dict__ between classes. Is it cool or is it wack?
	The other day I cooked up this pattern to suit my needs and I'm curious if it is a frowned-upon or normal. I haven't seen it in my search of Python OOP patterns.

I have a useful class with a general use case, but sometimes there are more specialized operations to be done. To encapsulate namespaces and clarify use cases, I pass the `__dict__` of the first to the second. The second class takes a copy of the first's attributes upon creation. but their methods are not accessible to one another. So far it's proven reliable and useful but I am unsure what to call this and if it is considered 'pythonic', if not what is a good alternative.

	 || Google Interview: Coding on Whiteboard Vs Chromebook
	I am preparing for an on-site interview at Google. During the candidate preparation class for interviewees, we were told we would have the option to code on a Chromebook in a basic text editor with syntax highlighting as an alternative to the whiteboard. 

As someone who stopped writing in school around grade 3 and was instead trained to type on a keyboard, and someone who usually codes on a computer (haha), the Chromebook sounds preferable. Perhaps most importantly,  as a left hander, it is exceedingly hard to use a whiteboard without holding my arm at a strange angle to avoid erasing everything with my palm, which serves to makes my handwriting even less legible.

The folks at Google I have spoken to about this (sample size 2) seem to have the opinion that the whiteboard is an old-school rite of passage, and to use the computer might convey that one is not the caliber of software engineer they'd hope for. Additionally, one of them said the whiteboard may serve to facilitate better communication between the candidate and interviewer.

Does anyone have opinions or experience with this choice? I am practicing on a whiteboard, but this only serves to highlight my preference to use the Chromebook/projector combo. It would be easier to manipulate the code, convey my ideas more clearly, and quickly. Better signal to noise ratio in my opinion.
