The article highlighted a written note she received from Moore upon her high-school graduation, and the handwriting appears to be quite similar to the inscription in one of his other accuser\u2019s yearbooks.\n\nThe new report not only reinforces allegations that Moore pursued teenagers while he was an adult, it also undermines the Senate candidate\u2019s denials about his conduct.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Republicans have decided to give Roy Moore\u2019s Senate candidacy a new round of support.\n\nThe Republican National Committee resumed supporting Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore on Monday after President Donald Trump earlier endorsed Moore, a Republican official said. The RNC dropped out of a joint fundraising agreement with Moore three weeks ago as Moore was hit with multiple accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago. NBC News reported at the time that it had also ended its field operations in the state, where it deployed 11 operatives.\n\nNow, however, the Republican establishment has reversed course, deciding Moore deserves the party\u2019s support after all.\n\nWhat changed? By all appearances, now that Donald Trump officially supports the accused child molester, Trump\u2019s party has decided to support him, too.\n\nAs we discussed yesterday, there\u2019s been an evolution in Trump World\u2019s thinking on the subject. As recently as Nov. 10 \u2013 hardly ancient history \u2013 White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in reference to the allegations surrounding Moore that the president \u201cbelieves that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 15, Ivanka Trump, a prominent White House aide and presidential daughter, said in apparent reference to Moore, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 19, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short added that Trump does, in fact, believe Moore\u2019s accusers.\n\nBut on Nov. 21, the shift began. The president suggested on camera that he believed Moore\u2019s denials. Yesterday, Trump has abandoned any sense of pretense, throwing support behind Moore at least in part because Democrats opposed his regressive and unpopular tax breaks.\n\nA White House spokesperson said in a press statement yesterday, \u201cThe president had a positive call with Judge Roy Moore during which they discussed the state of the Alabama Senate race and the president endorsed Judge Moore\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s backing evidently led to the RNC\u2019s backing, Moore\u2019s newest accuser notwithstanding. As Roy Moore faces new accuser, he receives new GOP support", "http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/childrens-health-program-imperiled-republican-tactics": "The Republican-led Congress was supposed to extend the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) by Oct. 1. As regular readers know, that was the day current funding for the program, which has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, expired. The deadline passed, however, because GOP lawmakers were focused on trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth care advocates initially hoped lawmakers would act soon after, and the missed deadline would be inconsequential. That was 59 days ago, and as of now, there is no solution and Republicans don\u2019t appear to be working on one.\n\nAs Slate noted, the real-world consequences are starting to emerge.\n\nColorado has notified residents that the federally funded Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program will shut down in early 2018 if Congress doesn\u2019t act to renew funding that expired on Sept. 30; the state appears to be the first to formally make such an announcement. A state press release says its program has enough money to continue operating until Jan. 31 of next year. Since the CHIP program is administered at the state level, the funding shortfall has different effects in different places, but estimates indicate that as many as four million children nationwide could lose coverage if it\u2019s not renewed.\n\nThere\u2019s long been a buffer built into the system, which is why no one panicked on Oct. 1. Everyone involved in the debate understood that states would move some money around until lawmakers got their act together. In fact, this wasn\u2019t the first time federal policymakers missed a CHIP deadline.\n\nThe point now, however, is that the GOP Congress\u2019 indifference has gone on so long that buffer is starting to disappear. Colorado is warning affected families now, and the Washington Post reported last week that \u201cnearly a dozen\u201d states are preparing to do the same thing.\n\nThe article added that five states may exhaust existing CHIP funding \u201cin late December if lawmakers do not act.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are of the opinion that they\u2019ve already acted: a few weeks ago, the chamber passed a highly partisan CHIP extension paid for through cuts to other health care programs. Not surprisingly, Democrats balked, and the bill hasn\u2019t been considered in the Senate, which is currently focused on trying to cut taxes for the wealthy.\n\nRumor has it that lawmakers may try to address CHIP funding in a year-end spending package, intended to prevent a government shutdown, but there\u2019s no guarantee that bill will come together, and for some states, the spending package may be too late to avoid interruptions in children\u2019s care.\n\nWatch this space.

After all, the GOP\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act were derailed by bipartisan opposition, and by tying tax cuts for the wealthy to health care policy, it raised the prospect of greater opposition to the latest Republican gambit.\n\nBut that only works if the GOP senators who helped rescue the health care system over the summer are willing to do so again now. Evidently, that may not be the case.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she would support repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual insurance mandate, giving a potential boost to the Republican effort to pass a massive tax cut package next week. \u201cI believe that the federal government should not force anyone to buy something they do not wish to buy, in order to avoid being taxed,\u201d Murkowski wrote in an opinion piece published Tuesday by the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a minute in order to better understand the landscape here. The original Republican plan was to overhaul the federal tax code in order to benefit the wealthy and corporations, but the effort ran into trouble when GOP officials couldn\u2019t get their numbers to add up. They needed more money to cover the cost of a permanent corporate tax break.\n\nAt Donald Trump\u2019s urging, Republicans determined they could repeal the \u201cObamacare\u201d individual mandate and have an additional $338 billion over the next decade to pay for more tax breaks. As we discussed a couple of weeks ago, for the right, this represented the best of both worlds: the GOP could gut the health care law they love to hate, and at the same time, they could redirect that money to finance tax cuts.\n\nThere was, however, a catch: the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained to lawmakers that repealing the ACA\u2019s individual mandate would destabilize the insurance market, force many consumers to pay higher premiums, and end coverage for 13 million Americans over the next decade. Hospitals, doctors, and insurers all said this was a very bad idea.\n\nThe result was effectively a caricature of Montgomery Burns-style policymaking: Republicans are pursuing a plan that would leave millions of families without health security, disproportionately hurt the poor, all in the hopes of redistributing wealth from the bottom up.\n\nAs of yesterday, Lisa Murkowski isn\u2019t yet prepared to say no to this.\n\nOn the contrary, even after being told about the consequences of repealing the ACA\u2019s individual mandate, she thinks the idea has merit.\n\nNow, in fairness, there are important nuances to the Alaska Republican\u2019s position. Murkowski has also said, for example, that she\u2019d like to see the Alexander-Murray compromise measure on market stabilization pass before her party\u2019s tax gambit goes through. This wouldn\u2019t fully mitigate the damage done by a mandate repeal, but she at least appears to be thinking about how best to prevent a GOP-imposed disaster.\n\nThat said, as 2017 has progressed, health care advocates have started to see Lisa Murkowski as an important ally in the fight against regressive and dangerous changes. Her comments this week put those advocates\u2019 confidence in doubt. Despite the risks, Murkowski backs ACA mandate repeal", "http://msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber/watch/mueller-follows-trump-money-trail-1111101507627": "Reuters reports Mueller subpoenaed Deutsche Bank to investigate whether they sold Trump\u2019s $300 million loan to a Russian bank.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Mueller follows Trump money trail", "http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-lying-or-ignorant-about-what-s-in-the-republican-tax-bill-1106584643871": "Rachel Maddow reports on the deep unpopularity of the Republican tax plan and notes that Donald Trump is wildly wrong to say that he'll pay more under the bill.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Trump lying or ignorant about what's in the Republican tax bill", "http://msnbc.com/msnbc-news/watch/russian-lawyer-says-trump-jr-sought-info-on-clinton-funds-1110642755726": "NBC News intelligence correspondent Ken Dilanian shares an exclusive report that Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnitskaya told the Senate that Donald Trump Jr. sought info on Clinton Foundation during their June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Russian lawyer says Trump Jr. sought info on Clinton funds", "http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/despite-talk-win-gop-tax-plan-loser-the-public": "Yesterday at the White House, Donald Trump boasted about how great he thinks the Republican tax plan is. \u201cI think people see that, and they\u2019re seeing it more and more,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd the more they learn about it, the more popular it becomes.\u201d\n\nAs is too often the case, what Trump said is pretty much the opposite of what\u2019s true.\n\nA Gallup poll found that 29% of people surveyed approved of the GOP tax bill, named the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while 56% disapproved. [\u2026] And a poll from Quinnipiac University also found that 29% of those surveyed approved of the bill while 53% disapproved.\n\nThe results of both of these surveys were quite brutal for supporters of the regressive GOP package. The Gallup and Quinnipiac results both pointed to an American mainstream that believes the Republican tax policy will deliver the bulk of its benefits to the wealthy and big corporations \u2013 which happens to be true.\n\nOf particular interest in the Quinnipiac data, the poll asked Americans which party they trust more on the issue of taxes. As recently as August, Democrats and Republicans were tied. Now, Dems have an eight-point advantage.\n\nAsked which party can do a better job \u201cfighting for the working class,\u201d Democrats are ahead, 56% to 34%.\n\nAfter Senate Republicans narrowly rammed through their tax plan in the middle of the night a few days ago, much of the coverage hailed the developments as a \u201cwin\u201d and an important \u201cvictory\u201d for the GOP and its leaders. And while that may have been true in one sense \u2013 Senate Republicans successfully passed what they wanted to pass \u2013 public revulsion toward their legislation makes it difficult to see the developments as some kind of triumph.\n\nThe HuffPost had an interesting item the other day, asking GOP senators for their reactions to the overwhelming evidence that the American mainstream isn\u2019t buying what they\u2019re selling. Several of the Republicans quoted suggested they simply don\u2019t believe the polls.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), however, argued, \u201cTax cuts are generally unpopular,\u201d as if GOP policymakers, desperate to improve their public standing, deliberately set out to do something the public disapproves of.\n\nThe trouble is, the evidence to the contrary is unambiguous: tax cuts are generally popular with the American mainstream. This plan isn\u2019t. The public is already inclined to believe the system is stacked in favor of the wealthy, and GOP officials are predictably facing resistance because they\u2019re doing the opposite of what voters want.\n\nAs we discussed in October, Republicans are working from the assumption that if they ignore popular will, they\u2019ll eventually be rewarded by the voters whose wishes they\u2019re ignoring.

The Washington Post reported the other day, \u201cAfter nearly a year of frustration, dysfunction and infighting, Republicans believe they are on the cusp of demonstrating that they can govern.\u201d The proof, apparently, is the GOP\u2019s progress on a regressive and unpopular tax plan.\n\nBut the confidence is borne of confusion. Ramming through poorly crafted legislation is an exercise in raw political power, but governing requires a very different skill set. A \u201cgoverning party,\u201d to use Paul Ryan\u2019s phrase, acts deliberately and judiciously, carefully examining an issue and paying attention to the consequences of every proposed solution.\n\nAny fool can write a piece of legislation, but to demonstrate an ability to govern requires forethought about what that legislation would do. With this in mind, Politico reports today that the Republicans\u2019 tax plan is \u201criddled with bugs, loopholes and other potential problems that could plague lawmakers long after their legislation is signed into law.\u201d\n\nSome of the provisions could be easily gamed, tax lawyers say. Their plans to cut taxes on \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses in particular could open broad avenues for tax avoidance. Others would have unintended results, like a last-minute decision by the Senate to keep the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to make sure wealthy people and corporations don\u2019t escape taxes altogether. For many businesses, that would nullify the value of a hugely popular break for research and development expenses. Some provisions are so vaguely written they leave experts scratching their heads\u2026. In many cases, Republicans are giving taxpayers little time to adjust to sometimes major changes in policy. An entirely new international tax regime, one experts are still trying to parse, would go into effect Jan. 1, only days after lawmakers hope to push the plan through Congress.\n\nGreg Jenner, a former top tax official in George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department, told Politico, \u201cThe more you read, the more you go, \u2018Holy crap, what\u2019s this?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo see this as evidence of Republicans being able to govern is to misunderstand what\u2019s happened. GOP policymakers wrote a bad bill in a bad way, ignoring problems that do exist while creating problems that don\u2019t exist. They ignored warnings, failed to think their actions through, rushed at breakneck speed, scribbled ideas into the margins of their legislative text, and approved sweeping legislation without reading it, scoring it, or fully understanding what it would do.\n\nI can appreciate the fact that most Americans probably don\u2019t much care about the nuances of the legislative process. But last week offered a striking example of an irresponsible process leading directly to an irresponsible result.\n\nThe editorial board of the Washington Post said congressional Republicans \u201cjust failed Governing 101.\u201d\n\nThe editors of Bloomberg View added, \u201cIn their rush to pass something, anything, that they can call \u2018tax reform,\u2019 congressional Republicans have achieved the impossible: They have made an awful plan even worse\u2026. The end result is sheer absurdity: a reform that actually complicates the tax code further, and that must contradict itself and partially self-destruct to attain some semblance of the fiscal discipline Republicans claim to value. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more egregious waste of time and energy, or a worse outcome for taxpayers and the broader economy.\u201d\n\nPostscript: I suspect some of my friends on the right will note that legislative drafting errors are common in every major bill, including the Affordable Care Act, so the Senate Republicans\u2019 missteps in the tax plan are not terribly surprising. There\u2019s some truth to that.\n\nThe point, however, is that a governing party at least tries to identify some of these pitfalls before a vote, through lengthy examinations in congressional hearings and outside scrutiny from subject-matter experts. GOP senators made a conscious decision in this case to do the opposite. \u201cThe more you read, the more you go, \u2018Holy crap, what\u2019s this?\u2019\u201d", "http://msnbc.com/stephanie-ruhle/watch/steve-case-small-startups-are-the-future-of-economy-1110701123686": "Steve Case, the founder and chairman of the Case Foundation, speaks about the new Republican tax plan along with the future of the American economy.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} Steve Case: Small startups are the future of economy", "http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/news-of-mueller-deutsche-bank-query-triggers-trump-team-freak-out-1110339140002": "Greg Farrell, investigative reporter for Bloomberg News, talks with Rachel Maddow about his reporting on the Robert Mueller investigation asking Deutsche Bank for information related to Donald Trump.\n\nDuration: {{video.duration.momentjs}} News of Mueller Deutsche Bank query triggers Trump team freak-out", "http://msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/future-of-clean-energy-moves-ahead-in-trump-era-1109859395864": "President Trump reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, two national monuments in Utah, on Monday.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) made the bizarre argument that tax cuts lead to growth, which leads to revenue, which \u201cactually lowers the debt.\u201d When NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd pressed her to point to any evidence to support her assumptions, she eventually replied:\n\n\u201cWell, talk to economists like Glenn Hubbard and Larry Lindsey and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who used to be head of the [Congressional Budget Office].\u201d\n\nThat was probably not the right thing to say.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin spoke to two of the three conservative economists Collins mentioned \u2013 Glenn Hubbard and Douglas Holtz-Eakin \u2013 and neither one believes the Republican tax plan pays for itself through revenue created by increased economic growth.\n\nCollins\u2019 communications director told the Post, \u201cSenator Collins did not mean to state definitively that the tax cut would pay for itself \u2013 I can see why you would think that reading the [\u201cMeet the Press\u201d] transcript, and, to be clear, she does believe that the cuts could potentially pay for themselves.\u201d\n\nReality notwithstanding.\n\nI\u2019m left with the feeling that Collins and her far-right brethren are pursuing this debate the wrong way. At the risk of sounding reductive, Republicans basically have a choice when presenting their argument: they can (a) say that economists agree with them, which means their regressive plan has some merit lent by experts; or (b) dismiss the relevance of economists and subject-matter experts, sticking instead to their ideology and partisan orthodoxy.\n\nDuring the health care debate, Republicans went with the latter. They realized that doctors, nurses, hospitals, insurers, and patient advocates said the GOP plan would be a disaster, but the party made a conscious decision not to care. Most Republicans said in no uncertain terms that industry stakeholders were simply irrelevant.\n\nIn the tax debate, they\u2019re trying the opposite course. It\u2019s not working. The awkward search for economists who support the GOP tax plan", "http://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-impeachment-measure-receives-58-house-democratic-votes": "If you\u2019ve been waiting for a congressional vote on the impeachment of Donald Trump, I have some good news and some bad news. The Washington Post reported on this afternoon\u2019s developments on the House floor:\n\nRepublicans and most Democrats in the House banded together Friday to stop an attempt to impeach President Trump. Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) came to the House floor at 12:13 p.m. Wednesday to offer articles of impeachment under special House rules requiring a floor vote; he returned to the floor at 1:34 to force that vote.\n\nNot surprisingly, it didn\u2019t go well. A total of 238 House Republicans voted to table the privileged resolution \u2013 in effect, killing the measure \u2013 and they were joined by 126 House Democrats, who also opposed it.\n\nThat said, 58 House Dems voted to advance the impeachment measure \u2013 that\u2019s nearly a third of the entire conference \u2013 while four Democrats voted \u201cpresent.\u201d (Six members, five Dems and one Republicans, did not vote.) Both House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) opposed it.\n\nAnd at this point, some of Donald Trump\u2019s detractors are probably wondering why it didn\u2019t fare better. After all, there\u2019s a fair amount of public support for the president\u2019s impeachment and Trump is facing credible allegations of serious misdeeds, including obstruction of justice.\n\nThe trouble, however, is that while this was a Trump impeachment measure, its author had a different kind of impeachment push in mind.\n\nRep. Al Green (D-Tex.) wrote a relatively detailed letter to his colleagues yesterday, making his case against Trump in writing. It did not mention Russia or Vladimir Putin. It made no reference to obstruction of justice. There wasn\u2019t a word about Trump\u2019s political operation possibly having coordinated with a foreign adversary during its attack on U.S. elections.\n\nInstead, Article I of Green\u2019s impeachment effort accused Trump of associating the presidency \u201cwith white nationalism, neo-Nazism, and hate.\u201d It condemned Trump\u2019s response to, among other things, the violence in Charlottesville over the summer and his criticism of football players protesting racism.\n\nArticle II accused Trump of \u201cinciting hatred and hostility,\u201d condemning the president\u2019s handling of transgender troops, his criticism of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria, and his description of Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) as \u201cwacky.\u201d\n\nThere was no third article. This was Green\u2019s case for impeachment in a nutshell. There\u2019s ample debate among experts as to what should and shouldn\u2019t constitute an impeachable offense, but it\u2019s not too big a surprise that today\u2019s measure pursued a definition that struggled to gain broad acceptance.\n\nThat said, while I\u2019m not going to pretend to know what will happen with the Trump-Russia scandal, I think it\u2019s safe to say that members who opposed today\u2019s impeachment resolution may have a different perspective if, say, the Office of Special Counsel accuses the president in writing of obstruction of justice.

On the one hand, Sasse does not support Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, and thinks it\u2019s a mistake for Republicans to help Jones\u2019 campaign.\n\nOn the other hand, the Nebraska Republican responded to news that the Republican National Committee is investing $170,000 into the Alabama race by saying it\u2019s a \u201cbad decision\u201d and a \u201cvery sad day.\u201d Sasse added that he believes Moore\u2019s accusers, as did other Republican officials. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d the senator asked this morning.\n\nAs it turns out, I think we know the answer. Indeed, when Donald Trump reversed course this week and embraced the right-wing candidate, the president wasn\u2019t exactly subtle.\n\n\u201cDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias explained yesterday, the connection between the Alabama race and tax breaks for the wealthy is growing stronger.\n\nBack before Moore was accused of enjoying sexual predation of teen girls, he was already a controversial figure due to his habit of defying valid court orders, his view that Muslims should be barred from serving in Congress, his view that homosexuality is a \u201ccriminal lifestyle,\u201d etc. The GOP establishment wanted to nominate someone else for the seat, but when Moore won, they embraced his despite his disregard for the rule of law and the Constitution because \u2013 in the immoral words of Rob Portman \u2013 \u201che\u2019s going to be for tax reform, I think.\u201d That same calculus applies today.\n\nThe vote-counting arithmetic is pretty straightforward.\n\nThe Senate Republicans\u2019 tax bill passed the other day with 51 votes, leaving GOP leaders will very little room for error. Members are now starting to realize, however, that the just-passed Senate bill is a mess that will need to be largely rewritten in conference committee. Republicans are determined to advance the negotiations quickly, but the Senate special election in Alabama is just six days away \u2013 and it\u2019s probably unrealistic to think the final version of the GOP tax plan will be ready for a vote by then.\n\nIf Doug Jones pulls off the upset, the Senate Republicans\u2019 majority will shrink from 52 members to 51. At that point, if any two GOP senators balk at the party\u2019s priority, it fails.\n\nHow likely is that? Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) already rejected his party\u2019s plan over deficit concerns, and it\u2019s hardly outlandish to believe Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) may reverse course if the final version is even more radical than the one she voted for on Friday night.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if it\u2019s a 51-49 Senate, individual Republican members would suddenly have considerable leverage, able to tell their leaders to meet their demands or else.\n\nWhat caused Republicans to discover that they\u2019re not that concerned about Roy Moore\u2019s child-molestation allegations anymore?

Reuters reported:\n\nNicaragua is set to join the Paris climate agreement, according to an official statement and comments from Vice President Rosario Murillo on Monday, in a move that leaves the United States and Syria as the only nations outside the global pact. Nicaragua has already presented the relevant documents at the United Nations, Murillo, who is also first lady, said on local radio on Monday.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting for context that when representatives from the Nicaraguan delegation balked at the Paris accords in 2015, it wasn\u2019t because they were fringe climate deniers embracing oddball conspiracy theories. It was actually the opposite: Nicaragua opposed the agreement because officials believed it didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nNow, however, as Rosario Murillo explained yesterday, Nicaragua sees the agreement as \u201cthe only instrument we have in the world that allows the unity of intentions and efforts to face up to climate change and natural disasters.\u201d\n\nAnd as a result, there are now only two countries on the planet that are operating outside the Paris accord: Syria, which is home to a brutal civil war, and the United States, which is home to Donald Trump, who announced an end to the country\u2019s commitment to the agreement in June.\n\nA Washington Post report added, \u201cSyria is also not set to join the next round of U.N. talks on climate change that are scheduled for mid-November in Germany.

That may change this week.\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show the other day, when there\u2019s a possible shutdown looming, the political world is ordinarily fascinated by the drama. It\u2019s a testament to just how frenetic the current environment is that the federal government will run out of money in two days, and much of the country probably isn\u2019t aware of the pending deadline.\n\nThe first step in preventing the government from shutting down will be a spending bill in the House. Politico reports that Republican leaders appear to have settled on a plan.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have promised conservatives that they won\u2019t grant concessions to Democrats to get enough votes for a stopgap spending bill \u2013 gaining GOP support but also raising the specter of a government shutdown later this month.\n\nAs John Boehner can attest, House Republican leaders are in an awkward position. There\u2019s a sizable contingent of far-right House members who don\u2019t like to vote for spending bills, pushing GOP leaders to turn to Democrats for votes. In this case, however, Dems have a lengthy list of priorities they\u2019d love to see tied to the temporary spending bill \u2013 called a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d (or CR) \u2013 which Republicans naturally oppose.\n\nSo, as of yesterday, House GOP leaders said they won\u2019t turn to Democrats for support, and will instead work with far-right members to pass a spending measure and prevent a shutdown.\n\nProblem solved? Of course not. That bill would go to the Senate, where it\u2019ll need 60 votes \u2013 which means persuading at least eight Democratic senators to vote with all 52 Senate Republicans. If the House passes a partisan, GOP-centric measure, Dems in the upper chamber will balk and the odds of a shutdown will improve.\n\nIn case this weren\u2019t quite messy enough, Democrats aren\u2019t exactly united on a strategy. The congressional minority party seems to realize that they have some leverage in the process \u2013 Republicans can\u2019t avoid a shutdown without some Democratic votes \u2013 but Dems have all kinds of demands, ranging from health care to Dreamer protections, and there\u2019s no real agreement within the party as to what to demand in exchange for votes on a spending bill.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, seems to be playing no constructive role in the process whatsoever, and he\u2019s reportedly told allies he thinks a government shutdown would be good for him.\n\nAs things stand, the House is scheduled to vote tomorrow on its spending bill, the same day the White House hosts a conversation with Congress\u2019 bipartisan leadership about keeping the government\u2019s lights on.\n\nIf the House passes a \u201cclean\u201d measure \u2013 simply extending current spending levels for two weeks \u2013 it\u2019s possible Dems will largely approve, making no real demands, and hold their fire for the next round of talks. It\u2019s also possible Democrats will expect something in return for preventing a shutdown.\n\nAll of this will play out very quickly, since Republicans have waited until the last minute to find a solution. Based on my best guess, I\u2019d put the likelihood of a shutdown at about 35%, but that could change based on how things unfold on Capitol Hill today.

The Republican president believes climate change is a conspiracy cooked up by the Chinese; he reflexively opposes any policy his predecessor supports; and Trump has no real interest in helping the United States compete internationally in the area of clean energy.\n\nAnd so, in March, the president issued an executive order instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to \u201creview\u201d the policy that intends to reduce carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. Today, as the Washington Post reports, the far-right officials who lead Trump\u2019s EPA took the next step.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt issued a proposed rule Tuesday that would repeal sweeping regulation aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing U.S. power plants. The move, aimed at bolstering the nation\u2019s struggling coal industry, will trigger an immediate court fight and could result in months, if not years of litigation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s that second part of the excerpt that stands out. The Trump administration took a deliberate step backwards today, but the policy implications aren\u2019t cut and dry. It\u2019s not as if power plants were working under one framework yesterday, which will be entirely different from the one that\u2019ll be in place tomorrow.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has already blocked implementation of the Obama-era policy. The Trump administration\u2019s new rule is really just a vague proposal to go in a more regressive direction, but we have no idea what the details of the new policy look like, or when we\u2019ll even see them. A New York Times report added that Trump\u2019s EPA intends to consider a new rule \u201cat some point.\u201d\n\nAll the while, the administration will try to fend off a series of lawsuits from environmental advocates, who may very well have some success in preserving Obama-era safeguards.\n\nVox\u2019s David Roberts had a good piece today, explaining that Trump, Pruitt, and their allies may find this endeavor more difficult than they fully appreciate.\n\nIn 2007, the Supreme Court ruled, in Massachusetts v. EPA, that carbon dioxide qualifies as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. If the EPA determines that carbon is a danger to public health, the court said, it must regulate carbon to reduce that danger. In 2009, the EPA issued its Endangerment Finding, demonstrating (based on intensive research and documentation) that greenhouse gases are in fact a danger to public health. The Supreme Court ruling plus the Endangerment Finding mean that the EPA is legally obligated to regulate carbon in such a way as to meliorate the danger it poses to public health. The only way EPA can escape that core legal obligation is to overturn the Endangerment Finding. Some conservative denialist groups, recognizing that fact, are pressuring Pruitt to attempt just that. Doing so, however, would likely prove impossible. It would have to pass legal review, and the simple fact is that the science overwhelmingly supports the EPA\u2019s case. Until denialists put together a much stronger scientific case (anything can happen), the debate over carbon policy is entirely shaped by the legal expectation that the EPA will meaningfully regulate carbon\u2026. The fact is, the EPA is legally obligated not just to reduce carbon from \u201cstationary sources\u201d like power plants, but to meliorate the danger it poses \u2013 that is, to reduce it significantly, in a way that meaningfully reduces risks.\n\nTrump, Pruitt, and their allies seem to be under the impression that they can simply scrap Obama-era environmental protections as if they were flipping a switch: Obama said yes; they\u2019ll say no.\n\nThe details aren\u2019t nearly that simple.

We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet,\u201d Trump tweeted in the first of two posts.\n\nAt face value, Trump described a less-than-ideal posture for his party: tax cuts for the wealthy are great, so elect the alleged child molester.\n\nIt\u2019s also problematic for the president to make the case that \u201cstopping crime\u201d is a priority, which is why he wants voters to support a candidate accused of sexual assault over a former federal prosecutor.\n\nBut it\u2019s also worth pausing to appreciate the evolution of Trump World\u2019s thinking on the scandal.\n\nAs recently as Nov. 10 \u2013 hardly ancient history \u2013 White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in reference to the allegations surrounding Moore that the president \u201cbelieves that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 15, Ivanka Trump, a prominent White House aide and presidential daughter, said in apparent reference to Moore, \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 19, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short added that Trump does, in fact, believe Moore\u2019s accusers.\n\nBut on Nov. 21, the shift began. The president suggested on camera that he believed Moore\u2019s denials. Today, Trump has abandoned any sense of pretense, throwing support behind Moore at least in part because Democrats opposed his regressive and unpopular tax breaks.\n\nThose reports from September about the president being an \u201cindependent,\u201d bound by \u201cno party,\u201d aren\u2019t holding up especially well.

In 1995, Congress passed a law moving the United States\u2019 Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, from Tel Aviv. The legislation, however, came with a catch: U.S. presidents could delay the move for security reasons.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what every president has done since. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama each signed waivers, keeping the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv. There\u2019s no great mystery as to why: because of Jerusalem\u2019s unique significance \u2013 politically, historically, theologically \u2013 putting the U.S. embassy in the city would signal that the United States sees Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s official capital. That would touch off a series of repercussions that would risk destabilizing the region and irreparably harming the Middle East peace process.\n\nDonald Trump vowed to do what his predecessors would not, though many (including me) never thought he\u2019d be foolish enough to follow through. Those assumptions were mistaken.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital on Wednesday, while also delaying moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, officials said. Though Trump will not relocate the embassy any time soon \u2013 one White House official told reporters it could take years \u2013 the president still intends to fulfill that promise made early in his administration. Senior administration officials called Trump\u2019s expected recognition of Jerusalem an affirmation of \u201creality\u201d \u2013 both historical and current, pointing out that the city is already home to Israel\u2019s parliament, supreme court and other government sites. Palestinians, however, also claim Jerusalem as their capital, and Trump\u2019s anticipated announcement has touched off an uproar in the Arab world.\n\nFor the record, the president will apparently sign the same waiver his recent predecessors signed, but (a) it\u2019s for logistical reasons, not security reasons; and (b) this doesn\u2019t much matter since he\u2019s apparently going to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and begin the process of formally relocating the U.S. embassy.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to politics is often transactional. Always looking for some kind of \u201cdeal,\u201d the Republican president routinely looks for ways to advance his agenda through some kind of exchange of interests.\n\nWhat makes today\u2019s announcement so unsettling is that Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be advancing his or the United States\u2019 interests at all. Many of our closest allies have urged him not to do this, but the president is ignoring them \u2013 in exchange for nothing.\n\nNBC News ran a good piece this morning, examining whether Trump\u2019s move advances U.S. interests in any way.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t, according to analysts. Some also warned Trump\u2019s decision could damage peace-building efforts in the Middle East as well as America\u2019s credibility as a respected world power. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine what U.S. interest it serves if you assume it has a basic interest in promoting a peaceful settlement to the conflict,\u201d said Dana Allin, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). \u201cIt flies in the face of his other goal of peace in the region,\u201d said Leslie Vinjamuri, associate fellow in U.S. and Americas program at the London-based Chatham House think tank. \u201cIf he does make this announcement it\u2019s going to undermine U.S. interests to bring peace and stability to the region.\u201d\n\nSlate\u2019s Isaac Chotiner wrote a related piece last night, noting that Trump isn\u2019t just undermining his own efforts at a peace plan, he\u2019s also inadvertently helping Iran.\n\nSo why do it? To keep a campaign promise Trump almost certainly didn\u2019t understand? Because he thinks satisfying far-right Israelis will help him with Jewish voters in the United States?\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, Trump has been willing to upend decades of bipartisan consensus on a range of international relationships \u2013 China, NATO, Australia, the Korean peninsula, Europe, etc. \u2013 but today\u2019s shift is clearly among the most dangerous.
