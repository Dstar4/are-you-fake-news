For example, it can cause corn to grow characteristics that will kill pests when they eat it so pesticides won\u2019t be needed at all. This, of course, is presented as good news for humanity as it could eliminate the need for pesticides, but there is a huge caveat: This same technology could also be used to target not just pests but also human beings.\n\nThere are lots of possibilities here. For example, crops of food can be engineered to cause infertility in humans and some suspect it\u2019s already being done; dropping sperm counts seem to indicate that something is indeed going on.\n\nA recent study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem that was published in the Human Reproduction Journal Update revealed that human sperm production dropped by 59.3 percent between 1973 and 2011, which is a huge decline that could have serious implications. Much of it has been blamed on chemical exposure, specifically chemical castrators like atrazine. After all, the sperm drops are particularly prevalent in Western nations like the U.S. where GMO foods are widely consumed.\n\nThis statistic is something that population control proponents are surely pleased about. Many believe it\u2019s being done intentionally, and it shows just how possible these frightening scenarios are. Just how far does this population control agenda go?\n\nBlack people have long been targeted in population reduction experiments\n\nThere have been lots of horrifying incidents in recent years in which blacks were targeted for experimentation and population reduction \u2013 and there could be many more that have yet to be exposed, so it\u2019s not too far-fetched to imagine they\u2019re being targeted right now by such technology. This is the topic of a new video lecture by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, called \u201cThe Science Agenda to Exterminate Blacks.\u201d In the video, he talks about the \u201cconcerted, organized and longstanding effort to eliminate African Americans from the gene pool\u201d and Africans in general.\n\nIn the video, he looks at how blacks have been targeted throughout the years. One of the more recent high-profile incidents was the lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan\u2019s water supply, an area largely populated by African Americans.\n\nIn another example, Pfizer officials were arrested in Nigeria a few years ago for illegally testing experimental antibiotics on children there. Eleven kids died and dozens of others were harmed in the incident.\n\nAdams believes that in the recent Ebola outbreak that gripped Africa, weaponized strains of the disease were allowed to escape there to test their epidemiological impact and try out new drugs and also to encourage more funding.\n\nThen there are the groups giving young African women vaccines like tetanus shots in the \u201cEliminate project\u201d that analysis showed had a high percentage of covert sterilization chemicals.\n\nVaccines are even believed to be used to target black babies. While everyone is susceptible to vaccine damage, they cause more damage in black babies than white ones. The genetic differences between black and white babies make it harder for black babies\u2019 bodies to clear mercury from vaccines out of their bodies. Interestingly, black boys who were given the MMR vaccine had a 340 percent higher risk of autism.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples, however, is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in the U.S. back in the 1930s in which poor, illiterate black men were left to suffer from syphilis intentionally so doctors could study the disease\u2019s progression and then dissect their bodies after they died.\n\nWith a track record like that, it\u2019s only natural to wonder if the latest genetic engineering technology is being used for similar unethical experiments in our food supply.\n\nSources include:\n\nNaturalNews.com\n\nNatural.News Have scientists programmed GMO food to reduce the population? Evidence suggests reduced sperm counts, especially in black men, are a result of weaponized food", "https://newstarget.com/2017-11-07-now-north-korean-hackers-have-stolen-submarine-and-warship-blueprints-from-south-korea.html": "North Korean hackers have stolen submarine and warship blueprints from South Korea, claims lawmaker\n\nNorth Korean hackers have stolen blueprints for South Korean warships and submarine from the database of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd, one of South Korea\u2019s largest shipbuilders, in April of last year. Though the identity of the perpetrators remained a mystery up until recently, it\u2019s now believed that North Korean hackers were responsible for the data breach.\n\n\u201cWe are almost 100 percent certain that North Korean hackers were behind the hacking and stole the company\u2019s sensitive documents,\u201d said Kyung Dae-soo, a South Korean lawmaker and member of the conservative Liberty Korea Party.\n\nAccording to DailyMail.co.uk, the Daewoo hacking was uncovered by a Ministry of Defense division tasked with investigating cybercrime cases. It\u2019s believed that the hackers took around 40,000 documents, though the exact sensitivity of these documents has not been revealed by the investigators.\n\nWhat is known is that the hackers stole 60 classified military documents. Included in those documents are information regarding vessels equipped with the Aegis Combat System, an integrated naval weapons system that utilizes powerful computer and radar technology. Currently, South Korea is one of six nations operating the system, with three destroyers of the Republic of Korea Navy making use of it. (Related: North Korea\u2019s nuclear missiles can now reach New York City, Boston and Los Angeles, analysts conclude\u2026 are you awake yet?)\n\nKyung, himself a member of the South Korean Parliament\u2019s National Defense Committee, has stated that he learned of the hack at an intelligence briefing last week. The findings were verified by military investigators who had been on the case for six months leading up to October of this year. He added that the investigative team pinpointed North Korean hackers due to the hacking method being highly similar to other hack jobs linked to the hermit kingdom.\n\nNo further comments on the matter have been issued by the South Korean Defense Ministry. A spokesperson for Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering stated that the company was unaware of the issue until Kyung addressed it, and that there were no immediate plans of releasing any statements concerning the hack.\n\nThough as per FoxBusiness.com, the company has begun to beef up its defenses after the hack came to light. Defense sources have criticized Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering for failing to secure its business intranet from the public internet.\n\nNorth Korea has yet to comment. However, the nation has either denied or outright ignored past accusations.\n\nFast facts on Unit 121\n\nIf North Korea is indeed behind the hack, then the data breach was most likely pulled off by the enigmatic Unit 121, a North Korean cyberwarfare agency. The bureau first came to international attention in 2014 when they allegedly hacked into Sony Pictures\u2019 computers prior to the release of \u201cThe Interview.\u201d This action-comedy centered around Seth Rogen and James Franco interviewing current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, as played by Randall Park.\n\nThough the information on Unit 121 has been relatively scarce until now, this is what we do know:\n\nThe agency is said to have been set up Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong-un\u2019s father and predecessor, almost two decades ago.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Unit 121 consists of over 1,700 state-sponsored hackers who are backed by over 5,000 support staff.\n\nWhile Unit 121 became globally known in 2014, the agency gained South Korea\u2019s attention as far back as 2004, when they supposedly tapped into the South Korean military\u2019s wireless communication network.\n\nIn addition to performing military data breaches, Unit 121\u2019s skills appear to be used for monetary gain as well. Back in 2011, South Korean police arrested five people who had been working with North Korean hackers to take in millions of dollars via online games. Just last October, North Korean hackers were linked to the theft of $60 million from Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank.\n\nVisit WWIII.news today to remain updated on any and all news revolving around North Korea.\n\nSources include:\n\nDailyMail.co.uk\n\nFoxBusiness.com\n\nBloomberg.com North Korean hackers have stolen submarine and warship blueprints from South Korea, claims lawmaker", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-12-04-how-relapses-from-illness-happen-researchers-discover-that-some-bacteria-hide-until-the-immune-system-calms-then-attack-again.html": "(Natural News) According to a study published in 2016, scientists have discovered a bacteria \u201calarm clock\u201d that can wake dormant Salmonella in the body which enables the bug to trigger a relapse.\n\nThe researchers from Imperial College London say that the \u201calarm clock\u201d is common among various types of bacteria, such as Salmonella and E. coli. Their discovery could explain why some people suffer repeated bouts of infections, like ear or urinary tract infections, even though they take antibiotics. The team aims to use these findings to look into \u201chard-to-treat infections.\u201d\n\nDr. Sophie Helaine, the lead author of the research from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said, \u201cWhenever bacteria such as Salmonella invade the body, around a third of the bugs \u2018cloak\u2019 themselves as a defence mechanism against the body\u2019s immune system. They enter a type of stand-by mode possibly to hide from the body\u2019s immune system, that means they are not killed by antibiotics. The bacteria stop replicating and can remain in this dormant state for days, weeks or even months. When the immune system attack has passed, some bacterial cells spring back to life and trigger another infection.\u201d\n\nDr. Helaine continued, \u201cThis is why, for instance, a woman may think she has recovered from a urinary tract infection \u2013 and yet days or weeks later it seems to return. Many patients may assume it\u2019s a different infection \u2013 but actually it\u2019s the same bug.\u201d (Related: Boosting immune system with natural methods offers many health benefits.)\n\nShe adds that these so-called persistent bacteria also \u201cfuel antibiotic resistance,\u201d and this is why patients end up taking many courses of antibiotics for one infection. Taking this amount of antibiotics means that some bacteria are \u201cdeveloping resistance.\u201d\n\nEarlier research from Dr. Helaine\u2019s lab determined that Salmonella bacteria go into stand-by mode by \u201cpoisoning\u201d themselves using toxins.\n\nIn the current study, the team showed a mechanism that Salmonella use \u201cto detoxify themselves.\u201d This wakes them from stand-by and lets them start growing again.\n\nDr. Helaine said it is possible that many bacteria use this same toxin, called TacT, to \u201cswitch into stand-by mode.\u201d These bacteria include those that cause many intestinal, ear, throat, or urinary tract infections and even tuberculosis.\n\nDr. Helaine shares that if they can determine how to control this particular mechanism and \u201cforce the bacteria out of stand-by\u201d they can then be treated with antibiotics, effectively killing them.\n\nFor the study, Dr. Helaine et al. used Salmonella cells in the laboratory to identify the bacterial alarm clock. The team tested a collection of over 4,000 proteins to look for those that wake the bacteria up. They isolated an enzyme called peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) that was an effective alarm clock.\n\nThe scientists have determined that the toxin TacT \u201cstops cell growth during times of attack by blocking protein production.\u201d When the conditions are more suitable for cell growth, Pth molecules eliminate the block on protein production and lets the growth continue.\n\nDr. Helaine concluded, \u201cWhen the bacteria are under attack they go to sleep and wait for better days. Then once the immune system attack has passed, the body is once again a favourable place to start an infection, and cell growth resumes.\u201d\n\nBoost your immune system naturally\n\nDon\u2019t wait until you need antibiotics to get better.
